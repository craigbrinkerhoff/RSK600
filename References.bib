  abstract = {Outgassing of carbon dioxide (CO2) from rivers and streams to the atmosphere is a major loss term in the coupled terrestrial-aquatic carbon cycle of major low-gradient river systems (the term ``river system'' encompasses the rivers and streams of all sizes that compose the drainage network in a river basin). However, the magnitude and controls on this important carbon flux are not well quantified. We measured carbon dioxide flux rates (FCO2), gas transfer velocity (k), and partial pressures (pCO2) in rivers and streams of the Amazon and Mekong river systems in South America and Southeast Asia, respectively. FCO2 and k values were significantly higher in small rivers and streams (channels {$<$}100 m wide) than in large rivers (channels {$>$}100 m wide). Small rivers and streams also had substantially higher variability in k values than large rivers. Observed FCO2 and k values suggest that previous estimates of basinwide CO2 evasion from tropical rivers and wetlands have been conservative and are likely to be revised upward substantially in the future. Data from the present study combined with data compiled from the literature collectively suggest that the physical control of gas exchange velocities and fluxes in low-gradient river systems makes a transition from the dominance of wind control at the largest spatial scales (in estuaries and river mainstems) toward increasing importance of water current velocity and depth at progressively smaller channel dimensions upstream. These results highlight the importance of incorporating scale-appropriate k values into basinwide models of whole ecosystem carbon balance.},

  abstract = {The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission expected to launch in 2021 will offer a unique opportunity to map river discharge at an unprecedented spatial resolution globally from observations of water surface elevation, width, and slope. Because river discharge will not be directly observed from SWOT, a number of algorithms of varying complexity have been developed to estimate discharge from SWOT observables. Outstanding issues include the lack of accurate prior information and parameter equifinality. We developed a new data assimilation discharge algorithm that aimed to overcome these limitations by integrating a data-driven approach to estimate priors with a model informed by hydraulic geometry relations. A comprehensive simulated dataset of 18 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithm and four different configurations (rectangular channel, generic channel, and geomorphologically classified channel with and without regularization) to assess the impact of progressively adding hydraulic geometry constraints to the estimation problem. The algorithm with the full set of constraints outperformed the other configurations with median Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.77, compared with -0.46, 0.31 and 0.66, while other error metrics showed similar improvement. Results from this study show the promise of this hybrid data-driven approach to estimating river discharge from SWOT observations, although a number of enhancements need to be tested to improve the operational applicability of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

  abstract = {The emission of biogenic gases from large rivers can be an important component of regional greenhouse gas budgets. However, emission rate estimates are often poorly constrained due to uncertainties in the air-water gas exchange rate. We used the floating chamber method to estimate the gas transfer velocity (k) of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Markland Pool of the Ohio River, a large tributary of the Mississippi River (U.S.A). We measured k every two weeks for a year at one site and at 15 additional sites distributed across the length of the pool during two summer surveys. We found that k was positively related to both water currents and wind speeds, with 46\% of the gas transfer attributable to water currents at low wind speeds (e.g., 0.5 m s-1) and 11\% at higher wind speeds (e.g., {$>$}2.0 m s-1). Gas transfer velocity was highly sensitive to wind, possibly because the direction of river flow was often directly opposed to the wind direction. Gas transfer velocity values derived for CH4 were consistently greater than those derived for CO2 when standardized to a Schmidt number of 600 (k600), possibly because the transfer of CH4, a poorly soluble gas, was enhanced by surfacing microbubbles. Additional research to determine the conditions that support microbubble enhanced gas transfer is merited.},

In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in space, and many river basins and most lakes\textemdash especially in the developing world and in sparsely populated regions\textemdash remain unmonitored. Satellite remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes. This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d'\'Etudes Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date. Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and hydrology models. A smaller number of studies have also addressed methods for computation of lake and reservoir storage change or have quantified improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.},

From concomitant measurements of the air-water CO2 gradient, we computed the gas transfer velocity of CO2. The gas transfer velocity is well correlated to wind speed and a simple linear regression function gives the most consistent fit to the data. Based on water current measurements, we estimated the contribution of water current induced turbulence to the gas transfer velocity, using the conceptual relationship of O'Connor and Dobbins (1958). This allowed us to construct an empirical relationship to compute the gas transfer velocity of CO2 that accounts for the contribution of wind and water current. Based on this relationship, the spatial and temporal variability of the gas transfer velocity in the Scheldt estuary was investigated. Water currents contribute significantly to the gas transfer velocity, but the spatial and temporal variability (from daily to seasonal scales) is mainly related to wind speed variability.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and the upcoming launch of the joint NASA/CNES/CSA/UKSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite point toward improved river discharge estimates in ungauged basins. Existing discharge methods rely on ``prior river knowledge'' to infer parameters not directly measured from space. Here, we show that discharge estimation is improved by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics. Using over 370,000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data, we test unsupervised learning and an ``expert'' method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing. This intervention, along with updates to model physics, constitutes a new method we term ``geoBAM,'' an update of the Bayesian At-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning's (BAM) algorithm. We tested geoBAM on Landsat imagery over more than 7,500 rivers (108 are gauged) in Canada's Mackenzie River basin and on simulated hydraulic data for 19 rivers that mimic SWOT observations without measurement error. geoBAM yielded considerable improvement over BAM, improving the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the Mackenzie River from -0.05 to 0.26 and from 0.16 to 0.46 for the SWOT rivers. Further, NSE improved by at least 0.10 in 78/108 gauged Mackenzie rivers and 8/19 SWOT rivers. We attribute geoBAM improvement to parameterizing rivers by type rather than globally, but prediction accuracy worsens if parameters are misassigned. This method is easily mapped to rivers at the global scale and paves the way for improving future discharge estimates, especially when coupled with hydrologic models.},

Our results indicate that AMHG is rightly understood as an expression of a river-wide model of hydraulics driven by changes in slope imposed upon AHG physics. The explanatory power of AHG and this river-wide model combine to determine whether AMHG exists: if both AHG and the river-wide model adequately describe hydraulics, then we show that AMHG is a necessary mathematical consequence of these two phenomena. We also orient these findings in the context of river discharge estimation and other applications.},

These systems have negative net ecosystem production ([NEP]=[GPP]\textendash R) and ratios of [GPP]/R of {$<$}1. This net heterotrophy can be sustained only if aquatic respiration is subsidized by organic inputs from the catchment. Such subsidies imply that organic materials that escaped decomposition in the terrestrial environment must become susceptible to decomposition in the linked aquatic environment. Using a moderate-sized catchment in North America, the Hudson River (catchment area 33500 km2), evidence is presented for the magnitude of net heterotrophy. All approaches (CO2 gas flux; O2 gas flux; budget and gradient of dissolved organic C; and the summed components of primary production and respiration within the ecosystem) indicate that system respiration exceeds gross primary production by \textasciitilde 200 g C m-2 year-1. Highly 14C-depleted C of ancient terrestrial origin (1000\textendash 5000 years old) may be an important source of labile organic matter to this riverine system and support this excess respiration. The mechanisms by which organic matter is preserved for centuries to millennia in terrestrial soils and decomposed in a matter of weeks in a river connect modern riverine metabolism to historical terrestrial conditions.},

By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9~Pg~C~y-1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9~Pg~y-1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

These can be estimated in streams with the open channel diel oxygen method (single or two stations) essentially relying on a mass balance of oxygen over a defined reach. The method is generally perceived as low cost and easy to apply with new drift free optic sensors. Yet, it remains challenging on several key issues reviewed here: measurements of gas transfer at the air-water interface, appropriate mixing of tracers, uncertainty propagation in the calculations, spatial heterogeneity in oxygen concentrations, the derivation of net primary production (NPP) or autotrophic respiration, and the temperature dependence of photosynthesis and respiration. An extremely simple modeling tool is presented in an Excel workbook recommended for teaching the basic principles of the method. The only method able to deal with stream spatial heterogeneity is the method by Demars et al. Example data, Excel workbook, and R script are provided to run stream metabolism calculations. Direct gas exchange determination is essential in shallow turbulent streams, but modeling may be more accurate in large (deep) rivers. Lateral inflows should be avoided or well characterized. New methods have recently been developed to estimate NPP using multiple diel oxygen curves. The metabolic estimates should not be systematically temperature corrected to compare streams. Other recent advances have improved significantly the open channel diel oxygen method, notably the estimation of respiration during daylight hours.},

The exponents are shown to depend only on the depth exponent in the hydraulic relation (p) and the exponent that reflects the form of the cross-section (r). The coefficients depend on p and r, but also on the slope exponent in the generalized hydraulic relation and on the physical characteristics of the section: bankfull width, bankfull maximum depth, hydraulic conductance, and slope. The theoretical ranges of coefficient and exponent values derived herein are generally consistent with the averages and individual observed values reported in previous studies. However, observed values of the exponents at particular cross-sections commonly fall outside the theoretical ranges. In particular, the observed value of the velocity exponent m is commonly greater than the theoretical value, suggesting that hydraulic conductance often increases more strongly with discharge than predicted by the assumed hydraulic relations. The developments presented here provide new theoretical insight into the ways in which hydraulic and geometric factors determine hydraulic geometry. This insight should help to explain the variation of at-a-station hydraulic geometry and may facilitate prediction of hydraulic geometry at river reaches where detailed measurements are unavailable.},

This algorithm has potential application to river h and S measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. The algorithm was tested using in situ data as a proxy for satellite measurements along a 22.4km reach of the River Severn, UK. First, the algorithm was run with gage measurements of h and S during a small, in-bank event in June 2007. Second, the algorithm was run with measurements of h and S estimated from four remote sensing images during a major out-of-bank flood event in July 2007. River width was assumed to be known for both events. Algorithm-derived estimates of river bathymetry were validated using in situ measurements, and estimates of roughness coefficient were compared to those used in an operational hydraulic model. Algorithm-derived estimates of river discharge were evaluated using gaged discharge. For the in-bank event, when lateral inflows from smaller tributaries were assumed to be known, the method provided an accurate discharge estimate (10\% RMSE). When lateral inflows were assumed unknown, discharge RMSE increased to 36\%. Finally, if just one of the three river reaches was assumed to be have known bathymetry, solutions for bathymetry, roughness and discharge for all three reaches were accurately retrieved, with a corresponding discharge RMSE of 15.6\%. For the out-of-bank flood event, the lateral inflows were unknown, and the final discharge RMSE was 19\%. These results suggest that it should be possible to estimate river discharge via SWOT observations of river water surface elevation, slope and width.},

  abstract = {The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission planned for launch in 2020 will map river elevations and inundated area globally for rivers {$>$}100 m wide. In advance of this launch, we here evaluated the possibility of estimating discharge in ungauged rivers using synthetic, daily ``remote sensing'' measurements derived from hydraulic models corrupted with minimal observational errors. Five discharge algorithms were evaluated, as well as the median of the five, for 19 rivers spanning a range of hydraulic and geomorphic conditions. Reliance upon a priori information, and thus applicability to truly ungauged reaches, varied among algorithms: one algorithm employed only global limits on velocity and depth, while the other algorithms relied on globally available prior estimates of discharge. We found at least one algorithm able to estimate instantaneous discharge to within 35\% relative root-mean-squared error (RRMSE) on 14/16 nonbraided rivers despite out-of-bank flows, multichannel planforms, and backwater effects. Moreover, we found RRMSE was often dominated by bias; the median standard deviation of relative residuals across the 16 nonbraided rivers was only 12.5\%. SWOT discharge algorithm progress is therefore encouraging, yet future efforts should consider incorporating ancillary data or multialgorithm synergy to improve results.},

  abstract = {Northern lakes are considered a major source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a potent GHG1,2. However, large uncertainties in their emissions (7\textendash 26\,Tg\,CH4\,yr\textendash 1; ref. 2) arise from challenges in upscaling field data, including fluxes by ebullition (bubbling), the dominant emission pathway2. Remote sensing of ebullition would allow detailed mapping of regional emissions but has hitherto not been developed. Here, we show that lake ebullition can be imaged using synthetic aperture radar remote sensing during ice-cover periods by exploiting the effect of ebullition on the texture of the ice\textendash water interface. Applying this method to five Alaska regions and combining spatial remote sensing information with year-round bubble-trap flux measurements, we create ebullition-flux maps for 5,143 Alaskan lakes. Regional lake CH4 emissions, based on satellite remote sensing analyses, were lower compared to previous estimates based on upscaling from individual lakes2,3 and were consistent with independent airborne CH4 observations. Thermokarst lakes formed by thaw of organic-rich permafrost had the highest fluxes, although lake density and lake size distributions also controlled regional emissions. This new remote sensing approach offers an opportunity to improve knowledge about Arctic CH4 fluxes and helps to explain long-standing discrepancies between estimates of CH4 emissions from atmospheric measurements and data upscaled from individual lakes.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of river discharge (RSQ) is a burgeoning field rife with innovation. This innovation has resulted in a highly non-cohesive subfield of hydrology advancing at a rapid pace, and as a result misconceptions, mis-citations, and confusion are apparent among authors, readers, editors, and reviewers. While the intellectually diverse subfield of RSQ practitioners can parse this confusion, the broader hydrology community views RSQ as a monolith and such confusion can be damaging. RSQ has not been comprehensively summarized over the past decade, and we believe that a summary of the recent literature has a potential to provide clarity to practitioners and general hydrologists alike. Therefore, we here summarize a broad swath of the literature, and find after our reading that the most appropriate way to summarize this literature is first by application area (into methods appropriate for gauged, semi-gauged, regionally gauged, politically ungauged, and totally ungauged basins) and next by methodology. We do not find categorizing by sensor useful, and everything from un-crewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to satellites are considered here. Perhaps the most cogent theme to emerge from our reading is the need for context. All RSQ is employed in the service of furthering hydrologic understanding, and we argue that nearly all RSQ is useful in this pursuit provided it is properly contextualized. We argue that if authors place each new work into the correct application context, much confusion can be avoided, and we suggest a framework for such context here. Specifically, we define which RSQ techniques are and are not appropriate for ungauged basins, and further define what it means to be `ungauged' in the context of RSQ. We also include political and economic realities of RSQ, as the objective of the field is sometimes to provide data purposefully cloistered by specific political decisions. This framing can enable RSQ to respond to hydrology at large with confidence and cohesion even in the face of methodological and application diversity evident within the literature. Finally, we embrace the intellectual diversity of RSQ and suggest the field is best served by a continuation of methodological proliferation rather than by a move toward orthodoxy and standardization.},

Such metabolic measurements offer important opportunities in fundamental and applied research, especially in relating stream metabolic responses to human and other pressures. The accurate determination of the reaeration coefficient is one challenge for making reliable ecological inferences from DO measurements made over many diel periods (i.e., months or years). We outline three methods for calculating atmospheric reaeration but concentrate on the use of statistical estimation to simultaneously estimate reaeration and metabolic rates using Bayesian model fitting. While there are existing programs (ModelMaker and Bayesian Metabolic Model [BaMM]), these are either slow or unable to be used easily for fitting multiple days of metabolic data (one to many months). Our implementation, BAyesian Single-station Estimation (BASE), uses freely available software (R and OpenBUGS), includes a batch mode that can fit data for many days, and provides visual and statistical measures of ``goodness-of-fit.'' We compare the results of the BASE, ModelMaker, and BaMM programs.},

The resulting data could provide an unprecedented account of river discharge at continental scales, but reliable methods need to be identified prior to launch. Here we present a novel algorithm for discharge estimation from only remotely sensed stream width, slope, and height at multiple locations along a mass-conserved river segment. The algorithm, termed the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm, implements a Bayesian formulation of streamflow uncertainty using a combination of Manning's equation and at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG). Bayesian methods provide a statistically defensible approach to generating discharge estimates in a physically underconstrained system but rely on prior distributions that quantify the a priori uncertainty of unknown quantities including discharge and hydraulic equation parameters. These were obtained from literature-reported values and from a USGS data set of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements at USGS stream gauges. A data set of simulated widths, slopes, and heights from 19 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithms using a set of performance metrics. Results across the 19 rivers indicate an improvement in performance of BAM over previously tested methods and highlight a path forward in solving discharge estimation using solely satellite remote sensing.},

Knowing this rate is necessary to calculate river photosynthesis and respiration, but there are few data from large rivers, and there are no data that include whitewater rapids. We studied the Colorado River, Grand Canyon; this river has flat reaches separated by extremely large, steep, whitewater rapids. We measured gas transfer velocity (the height of the water column that can exchange all of its gas per hour) by measuring how quickly the river gained oxygen as it flowed over the first 7 major rapids. The Colorado River has low oxygen concentration as it flows out of Glen Canyon Dam, located 25 kilometers upriver from Lees Ferry. We found that gas transfer velocity increased as river slope increased. Gas transfer velocity was low in flat reaches but was up to 800 times higher in rapids, which were the highest rates ever measured in a river. Based on the rate of change of oxygen concentration per meter of river drop, we estimated gas transfer velocity for the remainder of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. Gas exchange varied 5-fold depending on the slope of the immediate reach. Gas transfer velocity was higher for the Colorado River than for other aquatic ecosystems because of its large rapids. Our approach of scaling gas transfer velocity to the entire river will allow comparing gas transfer velocity across rivers that have variable river slopes, such as the Colorado River, Grand Canyon.},

  abstract = {Gas exchange across the air\textendash water boundary of streams and rivers is a globally large biogeochemical flux. Gas exchange depends on the solubility of the gas of interest, the gas concentrations of the air and water, and the gas exchange velocity (k), usually normalized to a Schmidt number of 600, referred to as k600. Gas exchange velocity is of intense research interest because it is problematic to estimate, is highly spatially variable, and has high prediction error. Theory dictates that molecular diffusivity and turbulence drives variation in k600 in flowing waters. We measure k600 via several methods from direct measures, gas tracer experiments, to modeling of diel changes in dissolved gas concentrations. Many estimates of k600 show that surface turbulence explains variation in k600 leading to predictive models based upon geomorphic and hydraulic variables. These variables include stream channel slope and stream flow velocity, the product of which, is proportional to the energy dissipation rate in streams and rivers. These empirical models provide understanding of the controls on k600, yet high residual variation in k600 show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations. The most appropriate method to estimate gas exchange depends on the scientific question along with the characteristics of the study sites. We provide a decision tree for selecting the best method to estimate k600 for individual river reaches to scaling to river networks.

We test this model using simulated data with realistic measurement errors to demonstrate that it accurately estimates the model parameters and that parameter uncertainties correctly scale with error in the observations and number of data points. Application of the model to field data from two productive stream ecosystems with substantial daily dissolved oxygen variation quantified the underlying physical and biological factors that control oxygen dynamics in these ecosystems and provided empirical support for a light saturation model of the photosynthesis-irradiance relationships at the ecosystem scale. Although inclusion of {$\delta$}18O-O2 provides a second oxygen budget, analysis of field data shows that metabolic and reaeration parameters can be accurately estimated by modeling the transient dynamics of dissolved oxygen concentration alone in relation to daily changes in water temperature and light regime. This model is particularly suited to low-gas exchange, high-productivity systems, which have thus far proved challenging to measure ecosystem metabolism accurately. The modeling framework is applicable to single-station, open-system experimental designs and provides a rigorous and generalizable framework for estimating ecosystem metabolism in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {AbstractRemote sensing has gained attention as a novel source of primary information for estimating river discharge, and the Mass conserved Flow Law Inversion (McFLI) approach has successfully estimated river discharge in ungauged basins solely from optical satellite data. However, McFLI currently suffers from two major drawbacks: 1) Existing optical satellites lead to temporally and spatially sparse discharge estimates, and 2) because of the assumptions required, McFLI cannot guarantee downstream flow continuity. Hydrological modeling has neither drawback, yet model accuracy is frequently limited by a lack of discharge observations. We therefore combine McFLI and models in a data assimilation framework applicable globally. We establish a daily ``ungauged'' baseline model for 28,998 reaches of the Missouri river basin forced by recently published global runoff data, which we do not calibrate. We estimate discharge via McFLI using {$\sim$}1 million width measurements made from 12,000 Landsat scenes and assimilate McFLI into the model before validating at 403 USGS gauges. Results show that assimilated discharges did not impair already accurate baseline flows and achieved median improvements of 28\% Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), 0.50 Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and 0.23 Kling Gupta Efficiency (KGE) where baseline performance was poor (defined as baseline negative NSE, 225/403 reaches). We ultimately improved flows at 92\% of these originally poorly modelled gauges, even though Landsat images only provide McFLI discharges at 1.5\% of reaches and 26\% of simulated days. Our results suggest that the combination of McFLI and state-of-the-art hydrology models can improve flow estimations in ungauged basins globally.This article is protected by copyright.

CO2 is typically supersaturated in streams because rates of organic matter decomposition exceed photosynthetic uptake, and because of inflow of CO2 supersaturated ground waters. Using the U.S. Geological Survey's NASQAN database, we calculated pCO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in 417 streams and rivers distributed across the contiguous United States over a 22-year period. In addition to demonstrating widespread supersaturation and distinct regional variation in pCO2 across the U.S., our analysis revealed that pCO2 significantly declined 78.4 ppmv y-1 from 1973 to 1994. This decline is not attributable to changes in terrestrial weathering or in-stream processes, but instead suggests large-scale declines in terrestrial CO2 production and import into aquatic ecosystems during this 22-year period.},

  abstract = {A traditional metric used in hydrology to summarize model performance is the Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Increasingly an alternative metric, the Kling\textendash Gupta efficiency (KGE), is used instead. When NSE is used, NSE = 0 corresponds to using the mean flow as a benchmark predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use KGE as a metric: negative KGE values are viewed as bad model performance, and only positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using the mean flow as a predictor does not result in KGE = 0, but {$\surd$} instead KGE = 1 - 2 {$\approx$} -0.41. Thus, KGE values greater than -0.41 indicate that a model improves upon the mean flow benchmark \textendash{} even if the model's KGE value is negative. NSE and KGE values cannot be directly compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on the coefficient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore, modellers who use the KGE metric should not let their understanding of NSE values guide them in interpreting KGE values and instead develop new understanding based on the constitutive parts of the KGE metric and the explicit use of benchmark values to compare KGE scores against. More generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of aggregated efficiency metrics and towards a framework based on purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more robust model adequacy assessment.},

Here we present the first global maps of CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) in rivers of stream orders 3 and higher and the resulting FCO2 at 0.5\textdegree{} resolution constructed with a statistical model. A geographic information system based approach is used to derive a pCO2 prediction function trained on data from 1182 sampling locations. While data from Asia and Africa are scarce and the training data set is dominated by sampling locations from the Americas, Europe, and Australia, the sampling locations cover the full spectrum from high to low latitudes. The predictors of pCO2 are net primary production, population density, and slope gradient within the river catchment as well as mean air temperature at the sampling location (r2 = 0.47). The predicted pCO2 map was then combined with spatially explicit estimates of stream surface area Ariver and gas exchange velocity k calculated from published empirical equations and data sets to derive the FCO2 map. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assessed the uncertainties of our estimates. At the global scale, we estimate an average river pCO2 of 2400 (2019\textendash 2826) \textmu atm and a FCO2 of 650 (483\textendash 846) Tg C yr-1 (5th and 95th percentiles of confidence interval). Our global CO2 evasion is substantially lower than the recent estimate of 1800 Tg C yr-1 although the training set of pCO2 is very similar in both studies, mainly due to lower tropical pCO2 estimates in the present study. Our maps reveal strong latitudinal gradients in pCO2, Ariver, and FCO2. The zone between 10\textdegree N and 10\textdegree S contributes about half of the global CO2 evasion. Collection of pCO2 data in this zone, in particular, for African and Southeast Asian rivers is a high priority to reduce uncertainty on FCO2.},

The precipitation forcing is from a recently published 0.1\textdegree{} global product that optimally merged gauge-, reanalysis-, and satellite-based data. To constrain runoff simulations, we use a set of machine learning-derived, global runoff characteristics maps (i.e., runoff at various exceedance probability percentiles) for grid-by-grid model calibration and bias correction. To support spaceborne discharge studies, the river flowlines are defined at their true geometry and location as much as possible\textemdash approximately 2.94 million vector flowlines (median length 6.8 km) and unit catchments are derived from a high-accuracy global digital elevation model at 3-arcsec resolution ( 90 m), which serves as the underlying hydrography for river routing. Our 35-year daily and monthly model simulations are evaluated against over 14,000 gauges globally. Among them, 35\% (64\%) have a percentage bias within {$\pm$}20\% ({$\pm$}50\%), and 29\% (62\%) have a monthly Kling-Gupta Efficiency {$\geq$}0.6 (0.2), showing data robustness at the scale the model is assessed. This reconstructed discharge record can be used as a priori information for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission's discharge product, thus named ``Global Reach-level A priori Discharge Estimates for Surface Water and Ocean Topography''. It can also be used in other hydrologic applications requiring spatially explicit estimates of global river flows.},

This work investigates the estimation of river discharge from simulated observations of the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission using a variant of the classical variational data assimilation method ``4D-Var.'' The variational assimilation scheme simultaneously estimates discharge, river bathymetry, and bed roughness in the context of a 1.5 D full Saint-Venant hydraulic model. Algorithms and procedures are developed to apply the method to fully ungauged basins. The method was tested on the Po and Sacramento Rivers. The SWOT hydrology simulator was used to produce synthetic SWOT observations at each overpass time by simulating the interaction of SWOT radar measurements with the river water surface and nearby land surface topography at a scale of approximately 1 m, thus accounting for layover, thermal noise, and other effects. SWOT data products were synthesized by vectorizing the simulated radar returns, leading to height and width estimates at 200 m increments along the river centerlines. The ingestion of simulated SWOT data generally led to local improvements on prior bathymetry and roughness estimates which allowed the prediction of river discharge at the overpass times with relative root mean squared errors of 12.1\% and 11.2\% for the Po and Sacramento Rivers, respectively. Nevertheless, equifinality issues that arise from the simultaneous estimation of bed elevation and roughness may prevent their use for different applications, other than discharge estimation through the presented framework.},

Four baseline data sets determine relations for bankfull geometry, i.e., bankfull depth, bankfull width, and down-channel slope as functions of bankfull discharge and bed surface median sediment size. These relations show a considerable degree of universality. This universality applies not only within the four sets used to determine the forms but also to three independent data sets as well. We study the physical basis for this universality in terms of four relations, the coefficients and exponents of which can be back calculated from the data: (1) a Manning-Strickler-type relation for channel resistance, (2) a channel-forming relation expressed in terms of the ratio of bankfull Shields number to critical Shields number, (3) a relation for critical Shields number as a function of dimensionless discharge, and (4) a ``gravel yield'' relation specifying the (estimated) gravel transport rate at bankfull flow as a function of bankfull discharge and gravel size. We use these underlying relations to explore why the dimensionless bankfull relations are only quasi-universal and to quantify the degree to which deviation from universality can be expected. The analysis presented here represents an alternative to extremal formulations to predict hydraulic geometry.},

To evaluate these, exponent data for 139 at-a-station sites and for 72 downstream cases were collected from the literature, and variations in the data analyzed. Histogram analysis revealed substantial differences in the exponents when considered independently, and to facilitate simultaneous comparison between the three exponents the data were plotted on tri-axial diagrams, with one axis per exponent. This was done for the at-a-station and downstream data separately. Variations within and between major climatic areas could be examined, and similarities between theoretically derived and empirically observed data appreciated. Some confusion in the literature is attributed to five basic observations. These are the fact that downstream relationships have been related to different flow levels in different studies; differences might be expected between gaging station and field data; several different methods of fitting lines to relationships have been applied; a concern has recently been expressed that simple power functions may not be the best way of empirically describing the hydraulic geometry relationships in some cases; and, finally, the debate on whether or not velocity decreases downstream at a constant flow frequency has been perpetuated and remains largely unresolved.},

Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32 Pg C yr-1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr-1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.},

  abstract = {Headwater streams are key sites of nutrient and organic matter processing and retention, but little is known about temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates as a result of the short duration of most metabolism measurements in lotic ecosystems. We examined temporal variability and controls on ecosystem metabolism by measuring daily rates continuously for 2~years in Walker Branch, a first-order deciduous forest stream. Four important scales of temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism rates were identified: (1) seasonal, (2) day-to-day, (3) episodic (storm-related), and (4) inter-annual. Seasonal patterns were largely controlled by the leaf phenology and productivity of the deciduous riparian forest. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic throughout the year with the exception of the open-canopy spring when GPP and ER rates were co-equal. Day-to-day variability in weather conditions influenced light reaching the streambed, resulting in high day-to-day variability in GPP particularly during spring (daily light levels explained 84\% of the variance in daily GPP in April). Episodic storms depressed GPP for several days in spring, but increased GPP in autumn by removing leaves shading the streambed. Storms depressed ER initially, but then stimulated ER to 2\textendash 3 times pre-storm levels for several days. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic in both years of the study, with annual GPP being similar (488 and 519~g O2~m-2~y-1 or 183 and 195~g~C~m-2~y-1) but annual ER being higher in 2004 than 2005 (-1,645 vs. -1,292 g~O2~m-2~y-1 or -617 and -485~g~C~m-2~y-1). Inter-annual variability in ecosystem metabolism (assessed by comparing 2004 and 2005 rates with previous measurements) was the result of the storm frequency and timing and the size of the spring macroalgal bloom. Changes in local climate can have substantial impacts on stream ecosystem metabolism rates and ultimately influence the carbon source and sink properties of these important ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Centre national d'\'etudes spatiales Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will estimate global river discharge using remote sensing. Synoptic remote sensing data extend in situ point measurements but, at any given point, are generally less accurate. We address two questions: (1)What are the scales at which river dynamics can be observed, given spatial sampling and measurement noise characteristics? (2) Is there an equation whose variables are the averaged hydraulic quantities obtained by remote sensing and which describes the dynamics of spatially averaged rivers? We use calibrated hydraulic models to examine the power spectra of the different terms in the momentum equation and conclude that the measurement of river slope sets the scale at which rivers can be observed. We introduce the reach-averaged Saint Venant equations that involve only observable hydraulic variations and which parametrize within-reach variability with a variability index that multiplies the friction coefficient and leads to an increased ``effective'' friction coefficient. An exact expression is derived for the increase in the effective friction coefficient, and we propose an approximation that requires only estimates of the hydraulic parameter variances. We validate the results using a large set of hydraulic models and find that the approximated variability index is most faithful when the river parameters obey lognormal statistics. The effective friction coefficient, which can vary from a few percent to more than 50\% of the point friction coefficient, is proportional to the riverbed elevation variance and inversely proportional to the depth. This has significant implications for estimating discharge from SWOT data.},

Air concentrations immediately above stream surfaces were close to mean atmospheric conditions except during calm summer nights. Piston velocity from 0.4 to 21.6~cm~h-1 was closely related to current velocity permitting calculation of evasion rates for entire streams. CO2 evasion rates were highest in midstream reaches (170\textendash 1,200~mmol~m-2~day-1) where CO2-rich soil water entered fast stream flow, while rates were tenfold lower (25\textendash 100~mmol~m-2~day-1) in slow-flowing lower reaches. CO2 evasion mainly derived from the input of CO2 in soil water. The variability of CO2 evasion along the two lowland streams covered much of the range in sub-Arctic and temperate streams reported previously. In budgets for the two stream catchments, loss of carbon from soils via the hydrological cycle was substantial (3.2\textendash 5.7~mmol~m-2~day-1) and dominated by CO2 consumed to form HCO3- by mineral dissolution (69\textendash 76\%) and export of organic carbon (15\textendash 23\%) relative to dissolved CO2 export (7\textendash 9\%).},

  abstract = {Surface waters contribute substantially to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. However, global estimates remain uncertain due to methodological difficulties, such as in precisely estimating gas transfer in steep upland streams. Here, we addressed the question of what drives CO2 evasion from steep mountainous stream network of the European Alps by assessing the spatial and temporal variation of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) for 148 streams and the gas transfer coefficient for CO2 (kCO2) for 88 locations within this 254 km2 watershed. Results show that log kCO2 can be predicted reasonably well (r2 = 0.71, p{$<$}0.001, n = 88) using a statistical model based on slope, average width, flow velocity and stream discharge. Also, most sites were supersaturated in CO2 with significant variation in pCO2 due to season (September vs. December) and time of day (day vs. night), but not stream order. Resulting median CO2 evasion rates were 145, 119, 46, 43, and 50 mg C m-2 h-1 at 1st to 5th order streams, respectively. CO2 evasion was dependent on season and time of day, with the highest evasion (184.0 kg C h-1) during growing season at nighttime, followed by 124.6 kg C h-1 during daytime. Dormant season nighttime evasion was 30.9 kg C h-1 and daytime evasion only 17.1 kg C h-1. Overall we conclude that CO2 evasion of steep mountainous streams depends on seasonal and diurnal variation in pCO2 and reach-specific variability in kCO2. These controls strongly alter landscape-scale CO2 evasion estimates, with implications for regional to global carbon budgets.},

Although some concepts of hydraulic geometry were proposed toward the end of the nineteenth century, the real impetus toward formulating a theory of hydraulic geometry was provided by the work of Leopold and Maddock (1953). A number of theories have since been proposed. Some of the theories are interrelated but others are based on quite different principles. All theories, however, assume that the river flow is steady and uniform and the river tends to attain a state of equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium. The differences are due to the differences in hydraulic mechanisms that the theories employ to explain the attainment of equilibrium by the river.},

Daily integrals of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration were measured for 447 d between May 1992 and November 1994 based on single station diel oxygen curves. In 1993 gross primary production averaged 2.5 g O\textsubscript{2} m\textsuperscript{-2}d\textsuperscript{-1} and ecosystem respiration averaged 3.5 g O\textsubscript{2} m\textsuperscript{-2}d\textsuperscript{-1} (maximum daily rates observed in summer were 12.6 and 11.7 g O\textsubscript{2} m\textsuperscript{-2}d\textsuperscript{-1}). During the investigation, 32 bed-moving spates (peak discharge {$>$}28 m\textsuperscript{3}/s) occurred. Bed-moving spates distinctly depressed primary production and ecosystem respiration. Spates shifted ecosystem metabolism toward heterotrophy (decreased P/R) because gross primary production was more affected than ecosystem respiration. Recovery rates of gross primary production were high in summer and low in winter. Recovery of ecosystem respiration showed less distinct seasonal variation. Energy flow through the system was calculated as the sum of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. Upper (maximum energy flow) and lower (resistant energy flow) boundaries were estimated, within which energy flow varied. The ratio of maximum to resistant energy flow, which ranged from 6.1 to 9.6, indicated that resistance to spates was small, at least after extended periods free of spates (5-8 wk).},

Despite the presence of mountain streams worldwide, we lack basic understanding of gas exchange through their turbulent surfaces, making global estimates of outgassing from streams and rivers difficult to constrain. Here we combine new estimates of gas transfer velocities from tracer gas additions in mountain streams with published data to cover streams differing in geomorphology and hydraulics. We find two different scaling relationships between the turbulence-induced energy dissipation rate and gas transfer velocity for low- and high-channel slope streams, indicating that gas exchange in streams exists in two states. We suggest that turbulent diffusion drives gas transfer velocity in low-energy streams; whereas turbulence entrains air bubbles in high-energy streams, and the resulting bubble-mediated gas exchange accelerates with energy dissipation rate. Gas transfer velocities in the high-energy streams are among the highest reported. Our findings offer a framework to include mountain streams in future estimates of gas fluxes from streams and rivers at the global scale.},

  abstract = {Boreal streams represent potentially important conduits for the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. The gas transfer coefficient of CO2 (KCO2) is a key variable in estimating this source strength, but the scarcity of measured values in lotic systems creates a risk of incorrect flux estimates even when stream gas concentrations are well known. This study used 114 independent measurements of KCO2 from 14 stream reaches in a boreal headwater system to determine and predict spatiotemporal variability in KCO2. The KCO2 values ranged from 0.001 to 0.207 min-1 across the 14 sites. Median KCO2 for a specific site was positively correlated with the slope of the stream reach, with higher gas transfer coefficients occurring in steeper stream sections. Combining slope with a width/depth index of the stream reach explained 83\% of the spatial variability in KCO2. Temporal variability was more difficult to predict and was strongly site specific. Variation in KCO2, rather than pCO2, was the main determinant of stream CO2 evasion. Applying published generalized gas transfer velocities produced an error of up to 100\% in median instantaneous evasion rates compared to the use of actual measured KCO2 values from our field study. Using the significant relationship to local slope, the median KCO2 was predicted for 300,000 km of watercourses (ranging in stream order 1\textendash 4) in the forested landscape of boreal/nemoral Sweden. The range in modeled stream order specific median KCO2 was 0.017\textendash 0.028 min-1 and there was a clear gradient of increasing KCO2 with lower stream order. We conclude that accurate regional scale estimates of CO2 evasion fluxes from running waters are possible, but require a good understanding of gas exchange at the water surface.},

  abstract = {Relationships between wind speed and gas transfer, combined with knowledge of the partial pressure difference of CO2 across the air-sea interface are frequently used to determine the CO2 flux between the ocean and the atmosphere. Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural-14C disequilibrium and the bomb-14C inventory methods. Some of the variability between different data sets can be accounted for by the suggested mechanisms, but much of the variation appears due to other causes. Possible causes for the large difference between two frequently used relationships between gas transfer and wind speed are discussed. To determine fluxes of gases other than CO2 across the air-water interface, the relevant expressions for gas transfer, and the temperature and salinity dependence of the Schmidt number and solubility of several gases of environmental interest are included in an appendix.},

Here the first field investigations are described supporting a new mechanistic model based on surface water turbulence that predicts gas exchange for a range of aquatic and marine processes. Findings indicate that the gas transfer rate varies linearly with the turbulent dissipation rate to the power in a range of systems with different types of forcing - in the coastal ocean, in a macro-tidal river estuary, in a large tidal freshwater river, and in a model (i.e., artificial) ocean.
