	abstract = {What hydraulic information can be gained from remotely sensed observations of a river's surface? In this study, we analyze the relationship between river bed undulations and water surfaces for an ungauged reach of the Xingu River, a first-order tributary of the Amazon river. This braided reach is crosscut more than 10 times by a ENVISAT (ENVironmental SATellite) track that extends over 100 km. Rating curves based on a modeled discharge series and altimetric measurements are used, including the zero-flow depth Z0 parameter, which describes river's bathymetry. River widths are determined from JERS (Japanese Earth Ressources Satellite) images. Hydrodynamic laws predict that irregularities in the geometry of a river bed produce spatial and temporal variations in the water level, as well as in its slope. Observation of these changes is a goal of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission, which has a final objective of determining river discharge. First, the concept of hydraulic visibility is introduced, and the seasonality of water surface slope is highlighted along with different flow regimes and reach behaviors. Then, we propose a new single-thread effective hydraulic approach for modeling braided rivers flows, based on the observation scales of current satellite altimetry. The effective hydraulic model is able to reproduce water surface elevations derived by satellite altimetry, and it shows that hydrodynamical signatures are more visible in areas where the river bed morphology varies significantly and for reaches with strong downstream control. The results of this study suggest that longitudinal variations of the slope might be an interesting criteria for the analysis of river segmentation into elementary reaches for the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission that will provide continuous measurements of the water surface elevations, the slopes, and the reach widths.},

	abstract = {Arctic rivers drain {\textasciitilde}15\% of the global land surface and significantly influence local communities and economies, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and global climate. However, trusted and public knowledge of pan-Arctic rivers is inadequate, especially for small rivers and across Eurasia, inhibiting understanding of the Arctic response to climate change. Here, we calculate daily streamflow in 486,493 pan-Arctic river reaches from 1984-2018 by assimilating 9.18 million river discharge estimates made from 155,710 satellite images into hydrologic model simulations. We reveal larger and more heterogenous total water export (3-17\% greater) and water export acceleration (factor of 1.2-3.3 larger) than previously reported, with substantial differences across basins, ecoregions, stream orders, human regulation, and permafrost regimes. We also find significant changes in the spring freshet and summer stream intermittency. Ultimately, our results represent an updated, publicly available, and more accurate daily understanding of Arctic rivers uniquely enabled by recent advances in hydrologic modeling and remote sensing.},

	abstract = {The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, planned to launch in 2022, is the first mission to focus on measuring hydrological processes in Earth's surface water. As such, SWOT will vastly expand observations of global rivers ≥100 m wide. SWOT will provide a variety of data products, including a global vector river product containing water surface elevation (WSE), width, slope, and estimated discharge. Practical application and consistency of the SWOT vector products requires a prior global river network database divided into reaches. Here, we introduce the SWOT River Database (SWORD). SWORD will serve as the framework for the SWOT river vector products consisting of river reaches (∼10 km long) and nodes (∼200 m spacing). We generate SWORD by combining several global river- and satellite-related data sets into one congruent product. When defining river reaches, we incorporate natural and human-created river obstructions, basin boundaries, tributary junctions, and SWOT orbit track information. SWORD contains a total of 213,485 reaches and 10.7 million nodes. Globally, 77.3\% of river reach lengths are between 10 and 20 km with a median reach length of 10.5 km. 95\% of river reaches ≥10 km will have sufficient SWOT observations to provide discharge estimates at least once per orbit cycle. SWORD also contains many useful hydrologic and morphological attributes and is designed to be expandable in the future. Even before the launch of SWOT, it can serve as a framework for global hydrologic analyses using models, in situ measurements, and additional satellite observations.},

The main results are curves showing the reaeration factor kL as function of σu, the rms value of the horizontal component of the velocity near the surface. Correlations are found for each of the cases, with scattering about average curves which might be purely random. However, large differences exist in the trends for the different cases. In order to generalize the results, and to apply them to cases where no data exist, an attempt is made to correlate σu with parameters of the mean flow, by means of a dissipation velocity uε calculated from the average dissipation. Good results are obtained for cases 1 and 2, and can be extended to correlate the data for case 3.},

Wind velocities, stream flow properties, and oxygen transfer rates were measured under a variety of cocurrent and countercurrent flow conditions. For pure open channel flows and pure wind-driven flows, respectively, the results of oxygen transfer measurement can be scaled by the simple forcing parameters and show good agreement with other laboratory studies. For wind/stream combined flows, the transfer velocity depends on the stream flow condition and wind shear velocity. Based on the magnitude of the bottom-shear induced transfer and the wind-shear induced transfer velocity, a criterion was proposed to determine the dominant mechanism for gas transfer in combined wind/stream driven flows. A simple additive model is developed for the reaeration coefficient in combined wind and stream flow-influenced environments. Also, the effects of tidal flow on reaeration in tidal estuaries are briefly discussed.},

The new formula for gas transfer across an air—seainterface depends not only on wind speed but also on wind-wave state. At the same wind speed, ahigher gas transfer velocity will be obtained for a more developed wind-sea, which is represented by asmaller spectral peak frequency of wind waves.We suggest that the large uncertainties in the traditionalrelationship of gas transfer velocity with wind speed be ascribed to the neglect of the effect of windwaves. The breaking-wave parameter can be regarded as a Reynolds number that characterizes theintensity of turbulence associated with wind waves in the downward-bursting boundary layer (DBBL).DBBL provides an effective way to exchange gas across the air—sea interface, which might be relatedto the surface renewal.},

	abstract = {Using Phillips equilibrium range theory and observational data, we show first that the total rates of wave energy dissipation estimated by the Hasselmann and Phillips dissipation models are substantially consistent with each other, though their original forms are different. Both are proportional to the cube of air friction velocity, u*3, with a weak dependence on wave age. As a direct manifestation of the wave energy dissipation processes, we reanalyze previous observational data of whitecap coverage and find that it has greater correlation with the wind speed or friction velocity than the wave period or wave age. However, the data scatter decreases remarkably when the breaking-wave parameter RB= u*2/νωpis used, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of air, and ωp, the wind-wave spectral peak frequency. Physical interpretation of RB with some related issues, and a discussion of the probability models of whitecap coverage in terms of a threshold mechanism, are also presented. We conclude that RB is a good parameter to effectively express the overall wave breaking behavior for the case of wind-waves in local equilibrium with the wind. Since RB can be expressed as the product of u*3 and the wave age, this result demonstrates a stronger dependence of whitecap coverage on wave age than expected by the previous description by power-laws of u* and by the two theoretical models. Our conclusion suggests that current dissipation models should also be modified to represent full properties of wind-wave breaking.},

Analysis of concurrent eddy covariance gas transfer and measured wavefield statistics supplemented by wave model hindcasts shows for the first time that wave-related Reynolds numbers collapse four open ocean data sets that have a wind speed dependence of CO2 transfer velocity ranging from lower than quadratic to cubic. Wave-related Reynolds number and wind speed show comparable performance for parametrizing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) which, because of its higher solubility, is less affected by bubble-mediated exchange associated with wave breaking.},

	abstract = {We measured the impact of riparian zone vegetation on ecosystem metabolism in paired forested and meadow reaches on 13 streams in southeastern Pennsylvania and Maryland, USA. Metabolism estimates were based on open-system measurements of dissolved oxygen changes, with reaeration determined from propane evasion. Daily gross primary productivity (GPP) in meadow and forested reaches averaged 2.85 and 0.86 g O2 m−2 d−1, respectively, at water temperatures of 12°C or greater when the forest canopy was developed and 1.74 and 1.09 g O2 m−2 d−1, respectively, at temperatures below 12°C when the canopy was bare. Community respiration (CR24) also was greater in meadow reaches than in forested reaches, averaging 5.58 and 3.57 g O2 m−2 d−1, respectively, in the warm season and 4.87 and 2.88 g O2 m−2 d−1, respectively, during the cold season. Thus, both meadow and forested reaches were heterotrophic. Forested reaches were always wider and nearly always shallower than companion meadow reaches. When ecosystem function was assessed per unit of stream length, the difference in average GPP between meadow and forested reaches was reduced from three-fold to 1.9-fold in the warm season, and mean GPP was greater in the forested reaches during the cold season. Mean CR24 per meter stream length was greater in forested reaches during both seasons. Even though riparian shading reduced primary productivity per unit area of streambed, the greater stream width of the forested reaches counteracted that reduction in part. Thus, when rates of ecosystem function were expressed per length of stream, differences between reaches were always smaller than when expressed per area, and activity per unit stream length was sometimes greater in forested reaches than in meadow reaches.},

These data can all be correlated by For large gas bubbles which do not behave like rigid spheres as the smaller ones do If the particles of the dispersed phase are not free to move under gravity and transfer is due to turbulence in the surrounding fluid, where P/v is the power dissipation per unit volume. This correlation applies to heat and mass transfer in mixing vessels where the solid phase is in the form of a singled submerged body and also predicts the small increase in mass transfer coefficients as the power dissipation level is increased beyond that needed for just completely suspending dispersed solid particles in mixing vessels. The correlation also applies to heat and mass transfer in turbulent fluids flowing through fixed beds of particles and through pipes.

Ces données peuvent toutes être mises sous la forme: Pour de grosses bulles gazeuses qui ne se comportent pas comme des sphères rigides contrairement aux petites bulles, on a: Si les particules de la phase dispersée ne sont pas libres de se déplacer sous l'action de la pesanteur et si le transfert est dû à la turbulence dans le fluide environnant, on a: ou P/v est la puissance dissipée par unité de volume. Cette relation s'applique au transfert de chaleur et de masse dans les mélangeurs où la phase solide se présente sous forme d'un corps unique fixe et submergé, et prévoit aussi le petit accroissement des coefficients de transfert de masse quand la quantité d'énergie dissipée est augmentée au-delà de ce qui est nécessaire pour disperser complèment les particules solides dans les mélangeurs. La relation s'applique aussi aux transferts de chaleur et de masse dans les fluides turbulents s'écoulant à travers les lits fixes et à travers les tubes.
Zusammenfassung
Es wurden Verfahren entwickelt zur Messung von Phasengrenzflächen in Gas-Flüssigkeits-Dispersionen. Hierdurch war es möglich, die Stofftransportkoeffizienten für die flüssige Phase bei Gas-Flüssigkeits-Dispersionen zu messen, wie sie in begasten Rührkesseln sowie in Kolonnen mit Sieb- und Sinterplatten vorkommen. Die Ergebnisse wurden kombiniert mit anderen veröffentlichten Daten über den Wärme- und Stoffaustausch in Flüssig-Flüssig- und Gas-Feststoff-Dispersionen, bei denen die verteilten Phase sich frei unter dem Einfluss der Schwerkraft bewegen, und solchen Daten, bei denen der Transport durch freie Konvektion von Kugeln erfolgt. Alle Daten können wie folgt korreliert werden: Für grosse Blasen, die sich nicht wie kleine starre Kugeln verhalten: Wenn die Partikel der verteilten Phase sich nicht frei unter dem Einfluss der Schwerkraft bewegen und der Stofftransport von der Turbulenz des umgebenden Fluidums abhängt, gilt: wobei P/v der Kraftverbrauch pro Volumeneinheit ist. Diese Korrelation kann angewandt werden auf den Wärme- und Stofftransport in Rührkesseln, in denen die feste Phase in Form eines einzelnen festen Körpers vorliegt, und für die Voraussage des leichten Ansteigens der Stofftransportkoeffizienten beim Ansteigen des Kraftverbrauchs bis unterhalb des Wertes, der benötigt wird, um die Feststoffteilchen in völliger Suspension zu halten. Die Korrelation kann auch beim Wärme- und Stofftransport turbulenter Medien in Schüttschichten und Rohren.},

	abstract = {Aquatic primary productivity produces oxygen (O2) and consumes carbon dioxide (CO2) in a ratio of 1.2. However, in aquatic ecosystems, dissolved CO2 concentrations can be low, potentially limiting primary productivity. Here, results show that a large drainage basin maintains its highest levels of gross primary productivity (GPP) when dissolved CO2 is diminished or undetectable due to photosynthetic uptake. Data show that, after CO2 is depleted, bicarbonate, an ionized form of inorganic carbon, supports these high levels of productivity. In fact, outputs from a process-based model suggest that bicarbonate can support up to 58\% of GPP under the most productive conditions. This is the first evidence that high levels of aquatic GPP are sustained in a riverine drainage network despite CO2 depletion, which has implications for freshwater ecology, biogeochemistry, and isotopic analysis.},

	abstract = {Streams and rivers are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, the magnitudes of these fluxes are uncertain, in part, because dissolved greenhouse gases (GHGs) can exhibit high spatiotemporal variability. Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are commonly used to describe temporal variability stemming from hydrologic controls on solute production and transport. This study assesses how the partial pressures of two GHGs—pCO2 and pCH4—vary across hydrologic conditions over 4 yr in eight nested streams and rivers, at both annual and seasonal timescales. Overall, the range of pCO2 was constrained, ranging from undersaturated to nine times oversaturated, while pCH4 was highly variable, ranging from 3 to 500 times oversaturated. We show that pCO2 exhibited chemostatic behavior (i.e., no change with Q), in part, due to carbonate buffering and seasonally specific storm responses. In contrast, we show that pCH4 generally exhibited source limitation (i.e., a negative relationship with Q), which we attribute to temperature-mediated production. However, pCH4 exhibited chemostasis in a wetland-draining stream, likely due to hydrologic connection to the CH4-rich wetland. These findings have implications for CO2 and CH4 fluxes, which are controlled by concentrations and gas transfer velocities. At high Q, enhanced gas transfer velocity acts on a relatively constant CO2 stock but on a diminishing CH4 stock. In other words, CO2 fluxes increase with Q, while CH4 fluxes are modulated by the divergent Q dynamics of gas transfer velocity and concentration.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas evasion from inland waters is a globally significant yet highly uncertain flux, especially in regard to effects of wetlands and hydrologic variability. We sampled five first-order and two second-order streams with variable wetland influence during storm events for dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O. We also calculated gas evasion rates. In first-order streams, pCO2 and pN2O were significantly higher in the stream with the most wetland influence (mean ± 1 std: 3,965 ± 1,504 and 1.18 ± 0.37 μatm, respectively) than the forested stream (2,927 ± 439 and 0.47 ± 0.08 μatm, respectively). In second-order streams, pCO2, pCH4, and pN2O were higher in the 14\% wetland stream (3,274 ± 825, 501 ± 207, and 1.37 ± 0.43 μatm, respectively) than in the 2\% wetland stream (1,858 ± 423, 137 ± 53, and 0.37 ± 0.08 μatm, respectively). In first-order streams, pCO2 in streams with wetland influence increased during rain events, while pCO2 in streams with little to no wetland influence decreased or remained constant. Generally, pCH4 and pN2O followed the same trend, except in one stream with intermediate wetland influence. Gas transfer velocity increased in all streams during storm events. However, the forested streams had higher gas transfer velocities than the wetland streams due to steeper topography. CO2, CH4, and N2O evasion peaked in one of the intermediate wetland streams at high flow (maximum: 66 g C·m−2·day−1, 177 mg C·m−2·day−1, and 9.7 mg N·m−2·day−1, respectively). These findings suggest that gases are shunted downstream in flatter, wetland streams, while gases are evaded closer to their source in steeper, forested streams.},

	abstract = {We commonly refer to state estimation theory in geosciences as data assimilation (DA). This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.

Half of the streams and rivers (49\%) showed positive pCO2–discharge responses, while significantly more (80\%) showed positive CO2 efflux–discharge responses. More CO2 efflux therefore occurred at higher discharge. While CO2 efflux tended to increase with discharge at all stream orders, pCO2 tended to decrease with discharge in small rivers (stream order 1–6) and increase in large rivers (stream order 7–10). Small streams and rivers tended to release more CO2 at higher discharge due to highly responsive gas transfer velocity. While high CO2 efflux in small streams (stream order 1–3) pointed to strong terrestrial input, high CO2 responsiveness in large rivers was likely due to increased riverine metabolism and river–corridor exchanges.},

	abstract = {Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon budget. However, our ability to predict carbon fluxes from stream systems remains uncertain, as pCO2 varies within streams at scales of 1–100 m. This makes direct monitoring of large-scale CO2 fluxes impractical. We incorporate CO2 input and output fluxes into a stream network advection-reaction model, representing the first process-based representation of stream CO2 dynamics at watershed scales. This model includes groundwater (GW) CO2 inputs, water column (WC), benthic hyporheic zone (BHZ) respiration, downstream advection, and atmospheric exchange. We evaluate this model against existing statistical methods including upscaling and multiple linear regressions through comparisons to high-resolution stream pCO2 data collected across the East River Watershed in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA). The stream network model accurately captures GW, evasion, and respiration-driven pCO2 variability and significantly outperforms multiple linear regressions for predicting pCO2. Further, the model provides estimates of CO2 contributions from internal versus external sources suggesting that streams transition from GW- to BHZ-dominated sources between 3rd and 4th Strahler orders, with GW, BHZ, and WC accounting for 49.3\%, 50.6\%, and 0.1\% of CO2 fluxes from the watershed, respectively. Lastly, stream network model atmospheric CO2 fluxes are 4-12x times smaller than upscaling technique predictions, largely due to relationships between stream pCO2 and gas exchange velocities. Taken together, this stream network model improves our ability to predict stream CO2 dynamics and efflux. Furthermore, future applications to regional and global scales may result in a significant downward revision of global flux estimates.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of river discharge is critically important for water resource management, climate modeling, and improved understanding of the global water cycle, yet discharge is poorly known in much of the world. Remote sensing holds promise to mitigate this gap, yet current approaches for quantitative retrievals of river discharge require in situ calibration or a priori knowledge of river hydraulics, limiting their utility in unmonitored regions. Recently, Gleason and Smith (2014) demonstrated discharge retrievals within 20–30\% of in situ observations solely from Landsat TM satellite images through discovery of a river-specific geomorphic scaling phenomenon termed at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG). This paper advances the AMHG discharge retrieval approach via additional parameter optimizations and validation on 34 gauged rivers spanning a diverse range of geomorphic and climatic settings. Sensitivity experiments reveal that discharge retrieval accuracy varies with river morphology, reach averaging procedure, and optimization parameters. Quality of remotely sensed river flow widths is also important. Recommended best practices include a proposed global parameter set for use when a priori information is unavailable. Using this global parameterization, AMHG discharge retrievals are successful for most investigated river morphologies (median RRMSE 33\% of in situ gauge observations), except braided rivers (median RRMSE 74\%), rivers having low at-a-station hydraulic geometry b exponents (reach-averaged b {\textless} 0.1, median RRMSE 86\%), and arid rivers having extreme discharge variability (median RRMSE {\textgreater} 1000\%). Excluding such environments, 26–41\% RRMSE agreement between AMHG discharge retrievals and in situ gauge observations suggests AMHG can meaningfully address global discharge knowledge gaps solely from repeat satellite imagery.},

This review summarizes six decades of HG research while surveying rational, extremal, and empirical attempts to derive HG’s underlying physical principles. In addition, so called non-Leopoldian forms of HG are discussed, expanding HG beyond its original construction to examine a range of research that invokes HG in novel ways. The recent discovery of at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) is also discussed in the context of previous HG literature. Finally, some common themes linking disparate HG research communities are described in conjunction with suggestions for possible new directions for HG research in the future.},

	abstract = {The future SWOT mission (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) will provide cartographic measurements of inland water surfaces (elevation, widths and slope) at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Given synthetic SWOT like data, forward flow models of hierarchical-complexity are revisited and few inverse formulations are derived and assessed for retrieving the river low flow bathymetry, roughness and discharge (A0,K,Q). The concept of an effective low flow bathymetry A0 (the real one being never observed) and roughness K, hence an effective river dynamics description, is introduced. The few inverse models elaborated for inferring (A0,K,Q) are analyzed in two contexts: (1) only remotely sensed observations of the water surface (surface elevation, width and slope) are available; (2) one additional water depth measurement (or estimate) is available. The inverse models elaborated are independent of data acquisition dynamics; they are assessed on 91 synthetic test cases sampling a wide range of steady-state river flows (the Froude number varying between 0.05 and 0.5 for 1km reaches) and in the case of a flood on the Garonne River (France) characterized by large spatio-temporal variabilities. It is demonstrated that the most complete shallow-water like model allowing to separate the roughness and bathymetry terms is the so-called low Froude model. In Case (1), the resulting RMSE on infered discharges are on the order of 15\% for first guess errors larger than 50\%. An important feature of the present inverse methods is the fairly good accuracy of the discharge Q obtained, while the identified roughness coefficient K includes the measurement errors and the misfit of physics between the real flow and the hypothesis on which the inverse models rely; the later neglecting the unobserved temporal variations of the flow and the inertia effects. A compensation phenomena between the indentifiedvalues of K and the unobserved bathymetry A0 is highlighted, while the present inverse models lead to an effective river dynamics model that is accurate in the range of the discharge variability observed. In Case (2), the effective bathymetry profile for 80km of the Garonne River is retrieved with 1\% relative error only. Next, accurate effective topography-friction pairs and also discharge can be inferred. Finally, defining river reaches from the observation grid tends to average the river properties in each reach, hence tends to smooth the hydraulic variability.},

	abstract = {Multi-satellite sensing of continental water surfaces (WS) represents an unprecedented and increasing potential for studying ungauged hydrological and hydraulic processes from their signatures, especially on complex flow zones such as anabranching rivers. However the estimation of discharge from WS observations only is a very challenging, ill-posed, inverse problem due to unknown bathymetry and friction in ungauged rivers, measurements nature, quality and spatio-temporal resolutions regarding the flow (model) scales. This paper proposes an effective 1D hydraulic modeling approach of sufficient complexity to describe anabranching river flows from sparse multisatellite observations using the HiVDI inverse method presented in Larnier et al. (2019) with an augmented control vector including a spatially distributed friction law K(x,h) depending on the flow depth h. It is shown on 71 km of the Xingu River (anabranching, Amazon basin) with altimetric water height timeseries that a fairly accurate upstream discharge hydrograph and effective patterns of channel bathymetry and friction can be inferred simultaneously. The coherence between the sparse observation grid and the fine hydraulic model grid is ensured in the optimization process by imposing a piecewise linear bathymetry profile b(x), which is consistent with the hydraulic visibility ofWS signatures (Garambois et al., 2017; Montazem et al., 2019). The discharge hydrograph Q(t) at observation times and effective bathymetry-friction b(x),K(x,h) patterns are retrieved from 8 years of satellite altimetry (ENVISAT) at 6 virtual stations (VS) along flow. Next, the potential of the forthcoming SWOT data, dense in space, is highlighted by inferring a discharge hydrograph and dense patterns of effective river bathymetry and friction; a physically consistent scaling of friction by reaches enables to consider more dense bathymetry controls. Finally a numerical analysis shows: (i) the importance of an unbiased prior information in the inference of a triplet Q,b(x),K(x,h) from WS observations; (ii) the clear signatures of river bottom slope break in low flows and width variations in high flows, through the analysis of the friction slope term, which is consistent with the findings of Montazem et al. (2019) from WS curvature analysis.},

From concomitant measurements of the air-water CO2 gradient, we computed the gas transfer velocity of CO2. The gas transfer velocity is well correlated to wind speed and a simple linear regression function gives the most consistent fit to the data. Based on water current measurements, we estimated the contribution of water current induced turbulence to the gas transfer velocity, using the conceptual relationship of O'Connor and Dobbins (1958). This allowed us to construct an empirical relationship to compute the gas transfer velocity of CO2 that accounts for the contribution of wind and water current. Based on this relationship, the spatial and temporal variability of the gas transfer velocity in the Scheldt estuary was investigated. Water currents contribute significantly to the gas transfer velocity, but the spatial and temporal variability (from daily to seasonal scales) is mainly related to wind speed variability.},

	abstract = {Water surface elevation (WSE), slope and width measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will enable spaceborne estimates of global river discharge. WSE will be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). InSAR measurements are vulnerable to contamination from layover, a phenomenon wherein radar returns from multiple locations arrive at the sensor simultaneously, rendering them indistinguishable. This study assesses whether layover will significantly impact the precision of SWOT estimates of global river discharge. We present a theoretical river layover uncertainty model at the scale of nodes and reaches, which constitute nominal 200 m and 10 km averages, respectively, along river centerlines. The model is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of SWOT radar interaction with topography covering a total of 41,233 node observations, across a wide range of near-river topographic features. We find that height uncertainty increases to a maximum value at relatively low values of topographic standard deviation and varies strongly with position in the swath. When applied at global scale, the calibrated model shows that layover causes expected height uncertainty to increase by only a modest amount (from 9.4 to 10.4 cm at the 68th percentile). The 68th percentile of the slope uncertainty increases more significantly, from 10 to 17 mm/km. Nonetheless, the 68th percentile discharge uncertainty increases only marginally. We find that the impact of layover on SWOT river discharge is expected to be small in most environments.},

This algorithm has potential application to river h and S measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. The algorithm was tested using in situ data as a proxy for satellite measurements along a 22.4km reach of the River Severn, UK. First, the algorithm was run with gage measurements of h and S during a small, in-bank event in June 2007. Second, the algorithm was run with measurements of h and S estimated from four remote sensing images during a major out-of-bank flood event in July 2007. River width was assumed to be known for both events. Algorithm-derived estimates of river bathymetry were validated using in situ measurements, and estimates of roughness coefficient were compared to those used in an operational hydraulic model. Algorithm-derived estimates of river discharge were evaluated using gaged discharge. For the in-bank event, when lateral inflows from smaller tributaries were assumed to be known, the method provided an accurate discharge estimate (10\% RMSE). When lateral inflows were assumed unknown, discharge RMSE increased to 36\%. Finally, if just one of the three river reaches was assumed to be have known bathymetry, solutions for bathymetry, roughness and discharge for all three reaches were accurately retrieved, with a corresponding discharge RMSE of 15.6\%. For the out-of-bank flood event, the lateral inflows were unknown, and the final discharge RMSE was 19\%. These results suggest that it should be possible to estimate river discharge via SWOT observations of river water surface elevation, slope and width.},

Though many such equations have been developed, errors remain large, pointing to a need for an additional degree of description. Noting that streams vary widely in hydraulic geometry, a set of laboratory studies ﬁnds that reaeration rates are enhanced by ‘‘macroroughness,’’ large bed variations that produce depth-scale form drag. This enhancement is accurately described by a theory that was successful in smooth-channel ﬂows, upon accounting for increases in near-surface turbulent energy dissipation rates caused by macroroughness. In addition, a set of runs featuring bubble entrainment exhibits very high absorption rates, which are characterized by a Froude number based on macroroughness size.},

We also compared k to ɛ and empirical parameters such as wind and current speeds. Measured k had a low correlation with the empirical parameters and a high correlation with ɛ, as indicated by the small-eddy model. The high ɛ values may have been regulated by topographic conditions, e.g., corals or seagrasses that generate wakes, and complex coastlines or large-scale (on the order of kilometers) topographic factors that generate horizontal current shear. Our measurements indicate that coastal k is regulated by ɛ and cannot be accurately determined using wind or current speeds.

	abstract = {Dissolved oxygen in streams is frequently depressed to undesirable levels by discharges of organic waste. Oxygen levels recover through "reaeration," the absorption of atmospheric oxygen. To model streams and allocate wasteloads, the "reaeration coefficient," the absorption rate per unit oxygen deficit, is commonly estimated by predictive formulae, which this study seeks to improve.
It opens with an extensive critical assessment of work in gas transfer theory, open-channel turbulence, flow resistance, and reaeration measurement and prediction. Available formulae and field data are evaluated by an original metric which eliminates the bias of earlier techniques. It reveals distinct differences in accuracy among types of formulae, and increasing predictability with stream slope. Despite numerous formulae based on mean depth, velocity and slope, predictive errors remain very large. Some variables are clearly missing.
One of these is streambed geometry. Reaeration measurements in a laboratory channel investigated flows over four types: smooth beds; uniform, large-scale gravel roughness; "macroroughness;" and riffle-pool sequences.
Smooth-bed runs support one fundamental theory of gas transfer, based on the turbulent energy dissipation rate, which links the large scales at which energy is produced to the small ones which perform the work of overcoming interfacial resistance. Uniform flows over large-scale gravel obey the same theory but are found to require adjustments in scaling dissipation rates.
"Macroroughness elements" are large variations in bed geometry which produce locally nonuniform flow and form drag--resulting in much greater near-surface dissipation. When applied to the fundamental theory, this energy increase accounts very accurately for the observed increases in reaeration rate. Including bed particle size as a variable, a modification to the fundamental theory incorporates both uniform and macrorough flows.
Other experiments analyze the contributions of riffles and pools to reaeration--including pool expansion losses, which cannot be captured by traditional uniform-flow formulae. For this stream type, the modification includes separate hydraulic variables for pools and riffles.
Overall, the work shows that reaeration coefficients may be accurately predicted using proper estimates for the near-surface dissipation rate of turbulent energy, accounting for spatial variations in its production.},

              . We measure velocity and concentration fluctuations below the air–water interface, from the viscous sublayer to the middle of the ‘source region’ where the effects of the surface are first felt. Our laboratory measurement technique uses quantitative imaging to collect simultaneous concentration and velocity fields, which are measured at a resolution that reveals the dynamics in the turbulent inertial subrange. Two-point statistics reveal the spatial structure of velocity and concentration fluctuations, and are examined as a function of depth beneath the air–water interface. There is a clear dominance of large scales at all depths for all quantities, but the relative importance of scales changes markedly with proximity to the interface. Quadrant analysis of the turbulent scalar flux shows a four-way balance of flux components far from the interface, which near the interface evolves into a two-way balance between motions that are raising and lowering parcels of low-concentration fluid.},

	abstract = {We investigate the relationship between turbulence statistics and coherent structures (CS) in an unstratified reach of the Snohomish River estuary using in situ velocity measurements and surface infrared (IR) imaging. Sequential IR images are used to estimate surface flow characteristics via a particle-image-velocimetry (PIV) technique, and are conditionally sampled to delineate the surface statistics of bottom-generated CS, or boils. In the water column, we find that turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production exceeds dissipation near the bed but is less than dissipation in the midwater column and that TKE flux divergence closes a significant portion of the measured imbalance. The surface boundary leads to divergence in upwelling CS, and leads to the redistribution of vertical TKE to the horizontal. Very near the surface, statistical anisotropy is observed at length scales larger than the depth H (3–5 m), while boil-scale motions of O(1)m are nearly isotropic and exhibit a −5/3 turbulent cascade to smaller scales. Conditional sampling suggests that TKE dissipation in boils is approximately 2 times greater on average than dissipation in ambient flow. Similarly, surface boils are marked by significantly greater velocity variance, upwelling, divergence, and TKE flux divergence than ambient flow regions. Coherent structures and their surface manifestation, therefore, play an important role in the vertical transport of TKE and the water column distribution of dissipation, and are an important component of the TKE budget.},

Currently, available K2 estimation equations generally yield poor estimates when applied to stream conditions different from those for which the equations were derived because they were derived from small databases composed of potentially highly inaccurate measurements. A large data set of K2 measurements made with tracer-gas methods was compiled from U.S. Geological Survey studies. This compilation included 493 reaches on 166 streams in 23 states. Careful screening to detect and eliminate erroneous measurements reduced the data set to 371 measurements. These measurements were divided into four subgroups on the basis of flow regime (channel control or pool and riffle) and stream scale (discharge greater than or less than 0.556 m3/s). Multiple linear regression in logarithms was applied to relate K2 to 12 stream hydraulic and water-quality characteristics. The resulting best-estimation equations had the form of semiempirical equations that included the rate of energy dissipation and discharge or depth and width as variables. For equation verification, a data set of K2 measurements made with tracer-gas procedures by other agencies was compiled from the literature. This compilation included 127 reaches on at least 24 streams in at least seven states. The standard error of estimate obtained when applying the developed equations to the U.S. Geological Survey data set ranged from 44 to 61\%, whereas the standard error of estimate was 78\% when applied to the verification data set.},

	abstract = {The evasion of greenhouse gases (including CO2, CH4, and N2O) from streams and rivers to the atmosphere is an important process in global biogeochemical cycles, but our understanding of gas transfer in steep (¿10\%) streams, and under varying flows, is limited. We investigated gas transfer using combined tracer injections of SF6 and salt. We used a novel experimental design in which we compared four very steep (18.4-29.4\%) and four moderately steep (3.7-7.6\%) streams and conducted tests in each stream under low flow conditions and during a high-discharge event. Most dissolved gas evaded over short distances (similar to 100 and similar to 200-400m, respectively), so accurate estimates of evasion fluxes will require sampling of dissolved gases at these scales to account for local sources. We calculated CO2 gas transfer coefficients (K-CO2) and found statistically significant differences between larger K-CO2 values for steeper (mean 0.465min(-1)) streams compared to those with shallower slopes (mean 0.109min(-1)). Variations in flow had an even greater influence. K-CO2 was substantially larger under high (mean 0.497min(-1)) compared to low flow conditions (mean 0.077min(-1)). We developed a statistical model to predict K-CO2 using values of streambed slopexdischarge which accounted for 94\% of the variation. We show that two models using slope and velocity developed by Raymond et al. (2012) for streams and rivers with shallower slopes also provide reasonable estimates of our CO2 gas transfer velocities (k(CO2);md(-1)). We developed a robust field protocol which could be applied in future studies.},

	abstract = {1. Rates of whole-system metabolism (production and respiration) are fundamental indicators of ecosystem structure and function. Although first-order, proximal controls are well understood, assessments of the interactions between proximal controls and distal controls, such as land use and geographic region, are lacking. Thus, the influence of land use on stream metabolism across geographic regions is unknown. Further, there is limited understanding of how land use may alter variability in ecosystem metabolism across regions. 2. Stream metabolism was measured in nine streams in each of eight regions (n = 72) across the United States and Puerto Rico. In each region, three streams were selected from a range of three land uses: agriculturally influenced, urban-influenced, and reference streams. Stream metabolism was estimated from diel changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in each stream reach with correction for reaeration and groundwater input. 3. Gross primary production (GPP) was highest in regions with little riparian vegetation (sagebrush steppe in Wyoming, desert shrub in Arizona/New Mexico) and lowest in forested regions (North Carolina, Oregon). In contrast, ecosystem respiration (ER) varied both within and among regions. Reference streams had significantly lower rates of GPP than urban or agriculturally influenced streams. 4. GPP was positively correlated with photosynthetically active radiation and autotrophic biomass. Multiple regression models compared using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) indicated GPP increased with water column ammonium and the fraction of the catchment in urban and reference land-use categories. Multiple regression models also identified velocity, temperature, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, GPP, coarse benthic organic matter, fine benthic organic matter and the fraction of all land-use categories in the catchment as regulators of ER. 5. Structural equation modelling indicated significant distal as well as proximal control pathways including a direct effect of land-use on GPP as well as SRP, DIN, and PAR effects on GPP; GPP effects on autotrophic biomass, organic matter, and ER; and organic matter effects on ER. 6. Overall, consideration of the data separated by land-use categories showed reduced inter-regional variability in rates of metabolism, indicating that the influence of agricultural and urban land use can obscure regional differences in stream metabolism.},

	abstract = {1. We studied whole-ecosystem metabolism in eight streams from several biomes in North America to identify controls on the rate of stream metabolism over a large geographic range. The streams studied had climates ranging from tropical to cool-temperate and from humid to arid and were all relatively uninfluenced by human disturbances. 2. Rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined using the open-system, two-station diurnal oxygen change method. 3. Three general patterns in metabolism were evident among streams: (1) relatively high GPP with positive NEP (i.e. net oxygen production) in early afternoon, (2) moderate primary production with a distinct peak in GPP during daylight but negative NEP at all times and (3) little or no evidence of GPP during daylight and a relatively constant and negative NEP over the entire day. 4. Gross primary production was most strongly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). A multiple regression model that included log PAR and stream water soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration explained 90\% of the variation in log GPP. 5. Ecosystem respiration was significantly correlated with SRP concentration and size of the transient storage zone and, together, these factors explained 73\% of the variation in R. The rate of R was poorly correlated with the rate of GPP. 6. Net ecosystem production was significantly correlated only with PAR, with 53\% of the variation in log NEP explained by log PAR. Only Sycamore Creek, a desert stream in Arizona, had positive NEP (GPP: R {\textgreater} 1), supporting the idea that streams are generally net sinks rather than net sources of organic matter. 7. Our results suggest that light, phosphorus concentration and channel hydraulics are important controls on the rate of ecosystem metabolism in streams over very extensive geographic areas.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Gas exchange is a parameter needed in stream metabolism and trace gas emissions models. One way to estimate gas exchange is via measuring the decline of added tracer gases such as sulfur hexafluoride ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SF$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). Estimates of oxygen ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}O$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) gas exchange derived from {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SF$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} additions require scaling via Schmidt number (\textit{Sc}) ratio, but this scaling is uncertain under conditions of high gas exchange via bubbles because scaling depends on gas solubility as well as \textit{Sc}. Because argon ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}O$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} have nearly identical Schmidt numbers and solubility, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} may be a useful tracer gas for estimating stream {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}O$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} exchange. Here we compared rates of gas exchange measured via {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SF$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} for turbulent mountain streams in Wyoming, USA. We measured {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} as the ratio of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}:{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}N$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS). Normalizing to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}N$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} confers higher precision than simply measuring [{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater}] alone. We consistently enriched streams with {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} from 1 to 18\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\%{\textless}/span{\textgreater} of ambient {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} concentration and could estimate gas exchange rate using an exponential decline model. The mean ratio of gas exchange of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} relative to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SF$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} was 1.8 (credible interval 1.1 to 2.5) compared to the theoretical estimate 1.35, showing that using {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SF$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} would have underestimated exchange of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Steep streams (slopes 11–12\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\%{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) had high rates of gas exchange velocity normalized to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{Sc}=600{\textless}/span{\textgreater} ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{k}600{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, 57–210\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}m d$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), and slope strongly predicted variation in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{k}600{\textless}/span{\textgreater} among all streams. We suggest that {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} is a useful tracer because it is easily measured, requires no scaling assumptions to estimate rates of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}O$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} exchange, and is not an intense greenhouse gas as is {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SF$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. We caution that scaling from rates of either {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ar{\textless}/span{\textgreater} or {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SF$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} gas exchange to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} is uncertain due to solubility effects in conditions of bubble-mediated gas transfer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Widely used models of gas exchange rates are based on empirical relationships linked to wind speed, even though physical processes other than wind are known to play important roles. Here the first field investigations are described supporting a new mechanistic model based on surface water turbulence that predicts gas exchange for a range of aquatic and marine processes. Findings indicate that the gas transfer rate varies linearly with the turbulent dissipation rate to the power in a range of systems with different types of forcing - in the coastal ocean, in a macro-tidal river estuary, in a large tidal freshwater river, and in a model (i.e., artificial) ocean. These results have important implications for understanding carbon cycling.},

	abstract = {Relationships between wind speed and gas transfer, combined with knowledge of the partial pressure difference of CO2 across the air-sea interface are frequently used to determine the CO2 flux between the ocean and the atmosphere. Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural-14C disequilibrium and the bomb-14C inventory methods. Some of the variability between different data sets can be accounted for by the suggested mechanisms, but much of the variation appears due to other causes. Possible causes for the large difference between two frequently used relationships between gas transfer and wind speed are discussed. To determine fluxes of gases other than CO2 across the air-water interface, the relevant expressions for gas transfer, and the temperature and salinity dependence of the Schmidt number and solubility of several gases of environmental interest are included in an appendix.},

	abstract = {Air-water gas transfer influences fundamental processes of aquatic systems such as photosynthesis, respiration, and greenhouse gas emission. Previous predictive models for gas transfer velocity (KL) often only apply to a small range of streams and rivers. Two “universal” scalings, KL ∼ 1/4 power of turbulent dissipation rate (ε1/4) and KL ∼ shear velocity (U*), deduced from classic thin-film theory and surface renewal theory, have been reported for lake and marine systems, but have not been adequately tested for streams or rivers. To test the two scalings and understand how KL varies across systems, we compiled 588 field measurements of KL, and used inverse modeling based on long-term high-frequency dissolved oxygen time series to estimate KL of 35 streams and rivers capturing a wide range of discharge (0–221 m3/s). We found that the two scalings held for both the KL estimated by inverse modeling and the KL from measurements and outperformed 23 previous models in predicting KL. Furthermore, the main driver of KL variation shifts from bottom friction to other factors with increasing stream/river size. In most streams and a few rivers, correlation between U* and KL is high, and discharge-KL relationships are strongly positive, indicating that turbulence generated by bottom friction dominates near-surface turbulence, a fundamental control of KL, thus, the two scaling models are applicable to these systems. However, most rivers (mean discharge {\textgreater}10 m3/s) show low correlations between U* and KL, suggesting biochemical factors and winds likely override bottom friction in driving near-surface turbulence and KL.},

Despite the presence of mountain streams worldwide, we lack basic understanding of gas exchange through their turbulent surfaces, making global estimates of outgassing from streams and rivers difficult to constrain. Here we combine new estimates of gas transfer velocities from tracer gas additions in mountain streams with published data to cover streams differing in geomorphology and hydraulics. We find two different scaling relationships between the turbulence-induced energy dissipation rate and gas transfer velocity for low- and high-channel slope streams, indicating that gas exchange in streams exists in two states. We suggest that turbulent diffusion drives gas transfer velocity in low-energy streams; whereas turbulence entrains air bubbles in high-energy streams, and the resulting bubble-mediated gas exchange accelerates with energy dissipation rate. Gas transfer velocities in the high-energy streams are among the highest reported. Our findings offer a framework to include mountain streams in future estimates of gas fluxes from streams and rivers at the global scale.},

In addition to remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS), with the development on satellite technologies, it becomes possible to asses rapid and economic solutions to determine a practical rainfall–runoff relation, particularly poorly gauged or ungauged basins. In this paper, Solakli Watershed which is located in Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey is selected as the study area. To determine the hydroelectric water potential in a poorly gauged basin, basin boundary and area, minimum maximum and mean elevation, slope information of the basin have been derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) techniques. IRS P5 stereo satellite data with 2.5-m spatial resolution has been used for deriving the DEM. This DEM is used to produce the flow direction and flow accumulation maps of the basin. Afterward, synthetic drainage network is obtained with the analysis of these maps. Using topographical data such as area, mean basin elevation and limited point observations of rainfall data; a regression model was derived for the whole watershed. This regression model was validated on a sub-basin with satisfactory results using mean areal rainfall which was calculated isohyetal map produced by kriging method.

In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in space, and many river basins and most lakes—especially in the developing world and in sparsely populated regions—remain unmonitored. Satellite remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes. This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d’Études Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date. Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and hydrology models. A smaller number of studies have also addressed methods for computation of lake and reservoir storage change or have quantified improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the capability of the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate river discharge, even for ungauged sites. Because of its frequent revisits (as little as every 3h) and adequate spatial resolution (250m), MODIS bands 1 and 2 have significant potential for mapping the extent of flooded areas and estimating river discharge even for medium-sized basins. Specifically, the different behaviour of water and land in the Near Infrared (NIR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is exploited by computing the ratio (C/M) of the MODIS channel 2 reflectance values between two pixels located within (M) and outside (C), but close to, the river. The values of C/M increase with the presence of water and, hence, with discharge. Moreover, in order to reduce the noise effects due to atmospheric contribution, an exponential smoothing filter is applied, thus obtaining C/M⁎. Time series of hourly mean flow velocity and discharge between 2005 and 2011 measured at four gauging stations located along the Po river (Northern Italy) are employed for testing the capability of C/M⁎ to estimate discharge/flow velocity. Specifically, the meanders and urban areas are considered the best locations for the position of the pixels M and C, respectively. Considering the optimal pixels, the agreement between C/M⁎ and discharge/flow velocity is fairly good with values in the range of 0.65–0.77. Additionally, the application to ungauged sites is tested by deriving a unique regional relationship between C/M⁎ and flow velocity valid for the whole Po river and providing only a slight deterioration of the performance. Finally, the sensitivity of the results to the selection of the C and M pixels is investigated by randomly changing their location. Also in this case, the agreement with in situ observations of velocity is fairly satisfactory (r{\textasciitilde}0.6). The obtained results demonstrate the capability of MODIS to monitor discharge (and flow velocity). Therefore, its application for a larger number of sites worldwide will be the object of future studies.},

An extensive new field data set for the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada quantifies robust positive relationships between in situ suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and remotely sensed visible/near-infrared reflectance. These relationships are exploited using SPOT and ASTER satellite images to map suspended sediment concentrations across the PAD for four days in 2006 and 2007, revealing strong variations in water sources and flow patterns, including flow reversals in major distributaries. Near-daily monitoring with 276 MODIS satellite images tracks hydrologic recharge of floodplain lakes, as revealed by episodic infusions of sediment-rich water from the Athabasca River. The timing and magnitude of lake recharge are linked to springtime water level on the Athabasca River, suggesting a system sensitive to changes in river flow regime. Moreover, recharge timing differentiates lakes that are frequently and extensively recharged from those recharged more rarely. Finally, we present a first estimation of river flow velocity based on remotely sensed SSC, though saturation may occur at velocities {\textgreater}0.6 m/s. Viewed collectively, the different remote sensing methodologies presented here suggest strong value for visible/near-infrared remote sensing of suspended sediment to assess hydrologic and sediment transport processes in complex flow environments.

To characterize the uncertainty across existing modeling and satellite approaches, the authors present ensembles of historic monthly global continental discharge estimates that enforce water mass balance over land and ocean. The authors combine independent measurements of ocean–landmass change from altimetry and GRACE with multiple estimates of evaporation minus precipitation (E − P) from remote sensing and reanalysis data to compute 28 time series of global discharge. Results reveal agreement in mass budget across approaches but a large spread in global E − P estimates that propagates into the discharge estimates. It is found that discharges with reanalysis-based E − P provide a closer comparison with current observation-based estimates. After combining GRACE- and altimetry-based mass change estimates with moisture convergences from reanalysis, the total annual mean continental discharge into the oceans is 38 550 ± 4800 km3 yr−1. Last, the authors provide continent-wise discharge estimates from GRACE and moisture convergences over land, compare them to other studies, and discuss implications for ocean modeling.},

	abstract = {A methodology to estimate in-bank river discharge exclusively from remotely sensed hydraulic data is developed. Water-surface width and maximum channel width measured from 26 aerial and digital orthophotos of 17 single channel rivers and 41 SAR images of three braided rivers were coupled with channel slope data obtained from topographic maps to estimate the discharge. The standard error of the discharge estimates were within a factor of 1.5–2 (50–100\%) of the observed, with the mean estimate accuracy within 10\%. This level of accuracy was achieved using calibration functions developed from observed discharge. The calibration functions use reach specific geomorphic variables, the maximum channel width and the channel slope, to predict a correction factor. The calibration functions are related to channel type. Surface velocity and width information, obtained from a single C-band image obtained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) AirSAR was also used to estimate discharge for a reach of the Missouri River. Without using a calibration function, the estimate accuracy was +72\% of the observed discharge, which is within the expected range of uncertainty for the method. However, using the observed velocity to calibrate the initial estimate improved the estimate accuracy to within +10\% of the observed. Remotely sensed discharge estimates with accuracies reported in this paper could be useful for regional or continental scale hydrologic studies, or in regions where ground-based data is lacking.},

	abstract = {Satellite passive microwave sensors provide global coverage of the Earth's land surface on a near-daily basis without severe interference from cloud cover. Using a strategy first developed for wide-area optical sensors, and in conjunction with even limited ground-based discharge information, such microwave data can be used to estimate river discharge changes, river ice status, and watershed runoff. Water surface area in a river reach increases as flow widens, and any temporally calibrated observation sensitive to changing water area monitors discharge. The sensor spatial resolution is less important than the scene-to-scene calibration and the contrast in upwelling radiance between water and land. We use the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) band at 36.5 GHz, descending orbit, horizontal polarization, and the resampled Level-3 daily global data product. The discharge estimator HR is a ratio of calibration-target radiance (expressed as brightness temperature), for a local land parcel unaffected by the river, to measurement-target brightness temperature, for a pixel centered over the river. At midlatitudes, pixel dimensions are approximately 25 km. Because of low emission from water surfaces, HR increases with discharge as in-pixel water area expands. It increases sharply once overbank flow conditions occur. River ice-cover is also detectable. The sensitivity and accuracy of the orbital measurements is tested along U.S. rivers monitored by in situ gaging stations, with favorable results. Other tests demonstrate that for seasonally variable rivers, AMSR-E can provide useful international measurements of daily river discharge even if only fragmentary monthly mean discharge data are available for calibration.},

	abstract = {Space-borne instruments can measure river water surface elevation, slope, and width. Remote sensing of river discharge in ungauged basins is far more challenging, however. This work investigates the estimation of river discharge from simulated observations of the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission using a variant of the classical variational data assimilation method “4D-Var.” The variational assimilation scheme simultaneously estimates discharge, river bathymetry, and bed roughness in the context of a 1.5 D full Saint-Venant hydraulic model. Algorithms and procedures are developed to apply the method to fully ungauged basins. The method was tested on the Po and Sacramento Rivers. The SWOT hydrology simulator was used to produce synthetic SWOT observations at each overpass time by simulating the interaction of SWOT radar measurements with the river water surface and nearby land surface topography at a scale of approximately 1 m, thus accounting for layover, thermal noise, and other effects. SWOT data products were synthesized by vectorizing the simulated radar returns, leading to height and width estimates at 200 m increments along the river centerlines. The ingestion of simulated SWOT data generally led to local improvements on prior bathymetry and roughness estimates which allowed the prediction of river discharge at the overpass times with relative root mean squared errors of 12.1\% and 11.2\% for the Po and Sacramento Rivers, respectively. Nevertheless, equifinality issues that arise from the simultaneous estimation of bed elevation and roughness may prevent their use for different applications, other than discharge estimation through the presented framework.},

Here we present evidence, using United States Geological Survey field measurements of channel hydraulics for 155 rivers, that AMHG can be hydraulically and geomorphically reconciled with AHG. Our results indicate that AMHG is rightly understood as an expression of a river-wide model of hydraulics driven by changes in slope imposed upon AHG physics. The explanatory power of AHG and this river-wide model combine to determine whether AMHG exists: if both AHG and the river-wide model adequately describe hydraulics, then we show that AMHG is a necessary mathematical consequence of these two phenomena. We also orient these findings in the context of river discharge estimation and other applications.},

Although some concepts of hydraulic geometry were proposed toward the end of the nineteenth century, the real impetus toward formulating a theory of hydraulic geometry was provided by the work of Leopold and Maddock (1953). A number of theories have since been proposed. Some of the theories are interrelated but others are based on quite different principles. All theories, however, assume that the river flow is steady and uniform and the river tends to attain a state of equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium. The differences are due to the differences in hydraulic mechanisms that the theories employ to explain the attainment of equilibrium by the river.},

	abstract = {Surface waters contribute substantially to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. However, global estimates remain uncertain due to methodological difficulties, such as in precisely estimating gas transfer in steep upland streams. Here, we addressed the question of what drives CO2 evasion from steep mountainous stream network of the European Alps by assessing the spatial and temporal variation of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) for 148 streams and the gas transfer coefficient for CO2 (kCO2) for 88 locations within this 254 km2 watershed. Results show that log kCO2 can be predicted reasonably well (r2 = 0.71, p{\textless}0.001, n = 88) using a statistical model based on slope, average width, flow velocity and stream discharge. Also, most sites were supersaturated in CO2 with significant variation in pCO2 due to season (September vs. December) and time of day (day vs. night), but not stream order. Resulting median CO2 evasion rates were 145, 119, 46, 43, and 50 mg C m−2 h−1 at 1st to 5th order streams, respectively. CO2 evasion was dependent on season and time of day, with the highest evasion (184.0 kg C h−1) during growing season at nighttime, followed by 124.6 kg C h−1 during daytime. Dormant season nighttime evasion was 30.9 kg C h−1 and daytime evasion only 17.1 kg C h−1. Overall we conclude that CO2 evasion of steep mountainous streams depends on seasonal and diurnal variation in pCO2 and reach-specific variability in kCO2. These controls strongly alter landscape-scale CO2 evasion estimates, with implications for regional to global carbon budgets.},

	abstract = {We measured CO2 concentration and determined evasion rate and piston velocity across the water–air interface in flow-through chambers at eight stations along two 20 km long streams in agricultural landscapes in Zealand, Denmark. Both streams were 9–18-fold supersaturated in CO2 with daily means of 240 and 340 μM in January–March and 130 and 180 μM in June–August. Annual CO2 medians were 212 μM in six other streams and 460 μM in four groundwater wells, while seven lakes were weakly supersaturated (29 μM). Air concentrations immediately above stream surfaces were close to mean atmospheric conditions except during calm summer nights. Piston velocity from 0.4 to 21.6 cm h−1 was closely related to current velocity permitting calculation of evasion rates for entire streams. CO2 evasion rates were highest in midstream reaches (170–1,200 mmol m−2 day−1) where CO2-rich soil water entered fast stream flow, while rates were tenfold lower (25–100 mmol m−2 day−1) in slow-flowing lower reaches. CO2 evasion mainly derived from the input of CO2 in soil water. The variability of CO2 evasion along the two lowland streams covered much of the range in sub-Arctic and temperate streams reported previously. In budgets for the two stream catchments, loss of carbon from soils via the hydrological cycle was substantial (3.2–5.7 mmol m−2 day−1) and dominated by CO2 consumed to form HCO3− by mineral dissolution (69–76\%) and export of organic carbon (15–23\%) relative to dissolved CO2 export (7–9\%).},

	abstract = {CO2 evasion from rivers (FCO2) is an important component of the global carbon budget. Here we present the first global maps of CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) in rivers of stream orders 3 and higher and the resulting FCO2 at 0.5° resolution constructed with a statistical model. A geographic information system based approach is used to derive a pCO2 prediction function trained on data from 1182 sampling locations. While data from Asia and Africa are scarce and the training data set is dominated by sampling locations from the Americas, Europe, and Australia, the sampling locations cover the full spectrum from high to low latitudes. The predictors of pCO2 are net primary production, population density, and slope gradient within the river catchment as well as mean air temperature at the sampling location (r2 = 0.47). The predicted pCO2 map was then combined with spatially explicit estimates of stream surface area Ariver and gas exchange velocity k calculated from published empirical equations and data sets to derive the FCO2 map. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assessed the uncertainties of our estimates. At the global scale, we estimate an average river pCO2 of 2400 (2019–2826) µatm and a FCO2 of 650 (483–846) Tg C yr−1 (5th and 95th percentiles of confidence interval). Our global CO2 evasion is substantially lower than the recent estimate of 1800 Tg C yr−1 although the training set of pCO2 is very similar in both studies, mainly due to lower tropical pCO2 estimates in the present study. Our maps reveal strong latitudinal gradients in pCO2, Ariver, and FCO2. The zone between 10°N and 10°S contributes about half of the global CO2 evasion. Collection of pCO2 data in this zone, in particular, for African and Southeast Asian rivers is a high priority to reduce uncertainty on FCO2.},

	abstract = {A traditional metric used in hydrology to summarize model performance is the Nash–Sutcliffe efﬁciency (NSE). Increasingly an alternative metric, the Kling–Gupta efﬁciency (KGE), is used instead. When NSE is used, NSE = 0 corresponds to using the mean ﬂow as a benchmark predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use KGE as a metric: negative KGE values are viewed as bad model performance, and only positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using the mean ﬂow as a predictor does not result in KGE = 0, but √ instead KGE = 1 − 2 ≈ −0.41. Thus, KGE values greater than −0.41 indicate that a model improves upon the mean ﬂow benchmark – even if the model’s KGE value is negative. NSE and KGE values cannot be directly compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on the coefﬁcient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore, modellers who use the KGE metric should not let their understanding of NSE values guide them in interpreting KGE values and instead develop new understanding based on the constitutive parts of the KGE metric and the explicit use of benchmark values to compare KGE scores against. More generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of aggregated efﬁciency metrics and towards a framework based on purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more robust model adequacy assessment.},

The resulting data could provide an unprecedented account of river discharge at continental scales, but reliable methods need to be identified prior to launch. Here we present a novel algorithm for discharge estimation from only remotely sensed stream width, slope, and height at multiple locations along a mass-conserved river segment. The algorithm, termed the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm, implements a Bayesian formulation of streamflow uncertainty using a combination of Manning's equation and at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG). Bayesian methods provide a statistically defensible approach to generating discharge estimates in a physically underconstrained system but rely on prior distributions that quantify the a priori uncertainty of unknown quantities including discharge and hydraulic equation parameters. These were obtained from literature-reported values and from a USGS data set of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements at USGS stream gauges. A data set of simulated widths, slopes, and heights from 19 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithms using a set of performance metrics. Results across the 19 rivers indicate an improvement in performance of BAM over previously tested methods and highlight a path forward in solving discharge estimation using solely satellite remote sensing.},

	abstract = {The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will measure water surface heights and widths for rivers wider than 100 m. At its native resolution, SWOT height errors are expected to be on the order of meters, which prevent the calculation of water surface slopes and the use of slope-dependent discharge equations. To mitigate height and width errors, the high-resolution measurements will be grouped into reaches (∼5 to 15 km), where slope and discharge are estimated. We describe three automated river segmentation strategies for defining optimum reaches for discharge estimation: (1) arbitrary lengths, (2) identification of hydraulic controls, and (3) sinuosity. We test our methodologies on 9 and 14 simulated SWOT overpasses over the Sacramento and the Po Rivers, respectively, which we compare against hydraulic models of each river. Our results show that generally, height, width, and slope errors decrease with increasing reach length. However, the hydraulic controls and the sinuosity methods led to better slopes and often height errors that were either smaller or comparable to those of arbitrary reaches of compatible sizes. Estimated discharge errors caused by the propagation of height, width, and slope errors through the discharge equation were often smaller for sinuosity (on average 8.5\% for the Sacramento and 6.9\% for the Po) and hydraulic control (Sacramento: 7.3\% and Po: 5.9\%) reaches than for arbitrary reaches of comparable lengths (Sacramento: 8.6\% and Po: 7.8\%). This analysis suggests that reach definition methods that preserve the hydraulic properties of the river network may lead to better discharge estimates.},

Here, we determined critical drivers of stream CO2 evasion at scales from 30 to 400 m across a 52.5 km2 catchment in northern Sweden. We found that turbulent reaches never have elevated CO2 concentrations, while less turbulent locations can potentially support a broad range of CO2 concentrations, consistent with global observations. The predictability of stream pCO2 is greatly improved when we include a proxy for soil-stream connectivity. Catchment topography shapes network patterns of evasion by creating hydrologically linked “domains” characterized by high water-atmosphere exchange and/or strong soil-stream connection. This template generates spatial variability in the drivers of CO2 evasion that can strongly bias regional and global estimates. To overcome this complexity, we provide the foundations of a mechanistic framework of CO2 evasion by considering how landscape process domains regulate transfer and supply.},

	abstract = {Headwater streams are key sites of nutrient and organic matter processing and retention, but little is known about temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates as a result of the short duration of most metabolism measurements in lotic ecosystems. We examined temporal variability and controls on ecosystem metabolism by measuring daily rates continuously for 2 years in Walker Branch, a first-order deciduous forest stream. Four important scales of temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism rates were identified: (1) seasonal, (2) day-to-day, (3) episodic (storm-related), and (4) inter-annual. Seasonal patterns were largely controlled by the leaf phenology and productivity of the deciduous riparian forest. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic throughout the year with the exception of the open-canopy spring when GPP and ER rates were co-equal. Day-to-day variability in weather conditions influenced light reaching the streambed, resulting in high day-to-day variability in GPP particularly during spring (daily light levels explained 84\% of the variance in daily GPP in April). Episodic storms depressed GPP for several days in spring, but increased GPP in autumn by removing leaves shading the streambed. Storms depressed ER initially, but then stimulated ER to 2–3 times pre-storm levels for several days. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic in both years of the study, with annual GPP being similar (488 and 519 g O2 m−2 y−1 or 183 and 195 g C m−2 y−1) but annual ER being higher in 2004 than 2005 (−1,645 vs. −1,292 g O2 m−2 y−1 or −617 and −485 g C m−2 y−1). Inter-annual variability in ecosystem metabolism (assessed by comparing 2004 and 2005 rates with previous measurements) was the result of the storm frequency and timing and the size of the spring macroalgal bloom. Changes in local climate can have substantial impacts on stream ecosystem metabolism rates and ultimately influence the carbon source and sink properties of these important ecosystems.},

This exchange is driven, in part, by the turbulent energy at the air?water interface. Turbulent energy at the air?water interface scales with the gas transfer velocity (k), which can be measured in streams through various methods. We performed a metadata analysis of studies that have measured k in streams using direct gas tracer releases. We evaluated models that predict k based on stream morphology. We found that models that use slope and velocity to predict k perform reasonably well and are consistent with general theory. We also used the data set to provide new stream hydraulic equations that predict stream morphology (width, depth, velocity) based on discharge.},

Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32 Pg C yr−1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr−1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.},

	abstract = {Understanding riverine carbon dynamics is critical for not only better estimates of various carbon fluxes but also evaluating their significance in the global carbon budget. As an important pathway of global land–ocean carbon exchange, the Yangtze River has received less attention regarding its vertical carbon evasion compared with lateral transport. Using long-term water chemistry data, we calculated CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) from pH and alkalinity and examined its spatial and temporal dynamics and the impacts of environmental settings. With alkalinity ranging from 415 to {\textgreater} 3400 µeq L⁻¹, the river waters were supersaturated with dissolved CO2, generally 2–20-fold the atmospheric equilibrium (i.e., 390 µatm). Changes in pCO2 were collectively controlled by carbon inputs from terrestrial ecosystems, hydrological regime, and rock weathering. High pCO2 values were observed spatially in catchments with abundant carbonate presence and seasonally in the wet season when recently fixed organic matter was exported into the river network. In-stream processing of organic matter facilitated CO2 production and sustained the high pCO2, although the alkalinity presented an apparent dilution effect with water discharge. The decreasing pCO2 from the smallest headwater streams through tributaries to the mainstem channel illustrates the significance of direct terrestrial carbon inputs in controlling riverine CO2. With a basin-wide mean pCO2 of 2662 ± 1240 µatm, substantial CO2 evasion from the Yangtze River fluvial network is expected. Future research efforts are needed to quantify the amount of CO2 evasion and assess its biogeochemical implications for watershed-scale carbon cycle. In view of the Yangtze River's relative importance in global carbon export, its CO2 evasion would be significant for global carbon budget.},

These relations show a considerable degree of universality. This universality applies not only within the four sets used to determine the forms but also to three independent data sets as well. We study the physical basis for this universality in terms of four relations, the coefficients and exponents of which can be back calculated from the data: (1) a Manning-Strickler-type relation for channel resistance, (2) a channel-forming relation expressed in terms of the ratio of bankfull Shields number to critical Shields number, (3) a relation for critical Shields number as a function of dimensionless discharge, and (4) a “gravel yield” relation specifying the (estimated) gravel transport rate at bankfull flow as a function of bankfull discharge and gravel size. We use these underlying relations to explore why the dimensionless bankfull relations are only quasi-universal and to quantify the degree to which deviation from universality can be expected.

Histogram analysis revealed substantial differences in the exponents when considered independently, and to facilitate simultaneous comparison between the three exponents the data were plotted on tri-axial diagrams, with one axis per exponent.

Variations within and between major climatic areas could be examined, and similarities between theoretically derived and empirically observed data appreciated. Some confusion in the literature is attributed to five basic observations. These are the fact that downstream relationships have been related to different flow levels in different studies; differences might be expected between gaging station and field data; several different methods of fitting lines to relationships have been applied; a concern has recently been expressed that simple power functions may not be the best way of empirically describing the hydraulic geometry relationships in some cases; and, finally, the debate on whether or not velocity decreases downstream at a constant flow frequency has been perpetuated and remains largely unresolved.},

	abstract = {Summary
This paper uses generalized expressions for both cross-section geometry and hydraulics (generalization of the Chézy and Manning relations) to derive explicit equations for the exponents and coefficients in the power-law at-a-station hydraulic–geometry relations. The exponents are shown to depend only on the depth exponent in the hydraulic relation (p) and the exponent that reflects the form of the cross-section (r). The coefficients depend on p and r, but also on the slope exponent in the generalized hydraulic relation and on the physical characteristics of the section: bankfull width, bankfull maximum depth, hydraulic conductance, and slope. The theoretical ranges of coefficient and exponent values derived herein are generally consistent with the averages and individual observed values reported in previous studies. However, observed values of the exponents at particular cross-sections commonly fall outside the theoretical ranges. In particular, the observed value of the velocity exponent m is commonly greater than the theoretical value, suggesting that hydraulic conductance often increases more strongly with discharge than predicted by the assumed hydraulic relations. The developments presented here provide new theoretical insight into the ways in which hydraulic and geometric factors determine hydraulic geometry. This insight should help to explain the variation of at-a-station hydraulic geometry and may facilitate prediction of hydraulic geometry at river reaches where detailed measurements are unavailable.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth’s surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

	abstract = {Lakes are central components of the inland water system distinct from, yet inextricably connected to, river networks. Currently, existing network-scale biogeochemistry research, although robust, typically treats each of these components separately or reductively. Here, we incorporate lake morphometry into a fully connected stream/lake network for the Connecticut River watershed and model potential evasion of terrestrially sourced headwater CO2 as transported through the network, ignoring in-stream production. We found that approximately 25\%–30\% of total potential soil CO2 evasion occurs in lakes, and percent evasion is inversely related to streamflow. A lake's ability to evade CO2 is controlled by residence time and size: most lakes with residence time over 7 days or surface area greater than 0.004 km2 evade functionally all terrestrial CO2 entering from upstream, precluding further downstream transport. We conclude that lakes are important for soil CO2 degassing and that this coupled river/lake approach is promising for CO2 studies henceforth.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and the upcoming launch of the joint NASA/CNES/CSA/UKSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite point toward improved river discharge estimates in ungauged basins. Existing discharge methods rely on “prior river knowledge” to infer parameters not directly measured from space. Here, we show that discharge estimation is improved by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics. Using over 370,000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data, we test unsupervised learning and an “expert” method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing. This intervention, along with updates to model physics, constitutes a new method we term “geoBAM,” an update of the Bayesian At-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning's (BAM) algorithm. We tested geoBAM on Landsat imagery over more than 7,500 rivers (108 are gauged) in Canada's Mackenzie River basin and on simulated hydraulic data for 19 rivers that mimic SWOT observations without measurement error. geoBAM yielded considerable improvement over BAM, improving the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the Mackenzie River from −0.05 to 0.26 and from 0.16 to 0.46 for the SWOT rivers. Further, NSE improved by at least 0.10 in 78/108 gauged Mackenzie rivers and 8/19 SWOT rivers. We attribute geoBAM improvement to parameterizing rivers by type rather than globally, but prediction accuracy worsens if parameters are misassigned. This method is easily mapped to rivers at the global scale and paves the way for improving future discharge estimates, especially when coupled with hydrologic models.},

However, emission rate estimates are often poorly constrained due to uncertainties in the air-water gas exchange rate. We used the floating chamber method to estimate the gas transfer velocity (k) of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Markland Pool of the Ohio River, a large tributary of the Mississippi River (U.S.A). We measured k every two weeks for a year at one site and at 15 additional sites distributed across the length of the pool during two summer surveys. We found that k was positively related to both water currents and wind speeds, with 46\% of the gas transfer attributable to water currents at low wind speeds (e.g., 0.5 m s?1) and 11\% at higher wind speeds (e.g., {\textgreater}2.0 m s?1). Gas transfer velocity was highly sensitive to wind, possibly because the direction of river flow was often directly opposed to the wind direction. Gas transfer velocity values derived for CH4 were consistently greater than those derived for CO2 when standardized to a Schmidt number of 600 (k600), possibly because the transfer of CH4, a poorly soluble gas, was enhanced by surfacing microbubbles. Additional research to determine the conditions that support microbubble enhanced gas transfer is merited.},

	abstract = {Outgassing of carbon dioxide (CO2) from rivers and streams to the atmosphere is a major loss term in the coupled terrestrial-aquatic carbon cycle of major low-gradient river systems (the term “river system” encompasses the rivers and streams of all sizes that compose the drainage network in a river basin). However, the magnitude and controls on this important carbon flux are not well quantified. We measured carbon dioxide flux rates (FCO2), gas transfer velocity (k), and partial pressures (pCO2) in rivers and streams of the Amazon and Mekong river systems in South America and Southeast Asia, respectively. FCO2 and k values were significantly higher in small rivers and streams (channels {\textless}100 m wide) than in large rivers (channels {\textgreater}100 m wide). Small rivers and streams also had substantially higher variability in k values than large rivers. Observed FCO2 and k values suggest that previous estimates of basinwide CO2 evasion from tropical rivers and wetlands have been conservative and are likely to be revised upward substantially in the future. Data from the present study combined with data compiled from the literature collectively suggest that the physical control of gas exchange velocities and fluxes in low-gradient river systems makes a transition from the dominance of wind control at the largest spatial scales (in estuaries and river mainstems) toward increasing importance of water current velocity and depth at progressively smaller channel dimensions upstream. These results highlight the importance of incorporating scale-appropriate k values into basinwide models of whole ecosystem carbon balance.},

	abstract = {In situ river discharge estimation is a critical component of studying rivers. A dominant method for establishing discharge monitoring in situ is a temporary gauge, which uses a rating curve to relate stage to discharge. However, this approach is constrained by cost and the time to develop the stage-discharge rating curve, as rating curves rely on numerous flow measurements at high and low stages. Here, we offer a novel alternative approach to traditional temporary gauges: estimating Discharge via Arrays of Pressure Transducers (DAPT). DAPT uses a Bayesian discharge algorithm developed for the upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography satellite (SWOT) to estimate discharge in situ derived from automated water surface elevation measurements. We conducted sensitivity tests over 4,954 model runs on five gauged rivers and conclude that the DAPT method can robustly reproduce discharge with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.79 and Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.78. Further, we find that the DAPT method estimates discharge similarly to an idealized temporary gauge created from the same input data (NSE differences of less than 0.1), and that results improve significantly with accurate priors. Finally, we test the DAPT method in nine poorly gauged rivers in a realistic and complex field setting in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, and show that the DAPT method largely outperforms a temporary gauge in this time and budget constrained setting. We therefore recommend DAPT as an effective tool for in situ discharge estimation in cases where there is not enough time or resources to develop a temporary gauge.

Unlike wind-based relationships, our model is applicable to systems ranging in size from less than 1 km2 to over 600 km2. Gas fluxes measured with our specific model of floating chambers can be grossly overestimated (by up to 1000\%), particularly in low-turbulence conditions. In high-turbulence regimes, flux overestimation decreases to within 50\%. Direct measurements of turbulent energy dissipation rate provide reliable estimation of the associated gas transfer velocity even at short temporal and spatial scales.},

We also estimate a source of 1.3 ± 0.7 Pg C year–1 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1 partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1.

	abstract = {The state of ocean CO2 uptake
The ocean is an important sink for anthropogenic CO2 and has absorbed roughly 30\% of our emissions between the beginning of the industrial revolution and the mid-1990s. This effect is an important moderator of climate change, but can we count on it to remain as strong in the future? Gruber et al. calculated the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 for the interval from 1994 to 2007, which continued as expected. They also observed clear regional deviations from this pattern, suggesting that there is no guarantee that uptake will remain as robust with time.
Science, this issue p. 1193
We quantify the oceanic sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) over the period 1994 to 2007 by using observations from the global repeat hydrography program and contrasting them to observations from the 1990s. Using a linear regression–based method, we find a global increase in the anthropogenic CO2 inventory of 34 ± 4 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) between 1994 and 2007. This is equivalent to an average uptake rate of 2.6 ± 0.3 Pg C year−1 and represents 31 ± 4\% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions over this period. Although this global ocean sink estimate is consistent with the expectation of the ocean uptake having increased in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2, substantial regional differences in storage rate are found, likely owing to climate variability–driven changes in ocean circulation.
Ocean uptake of atmospheric CO2 continued apace between 1994 and 2007.

	abstract = {Flow in rivers and the coastal ocean is controlled by the frictional force exerted on the water by riverbed or seabed roughness. The frictional force is typically characterized by a drag coefficient Cd, which is estimated from bulk measurements and often assumed constant. Here, we demonstrate a relationship between bed roughness and water surface turbulence that can be used to make remote estimates of Cd. We observe that regions with larger bed roughness result in greater turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which is transported upward by river boils to the water surface. We present a relationship between surface TKE and Cd, and validate this relationship by comparing remotely sensed estimates of Cd to those from in situ measurements. Thus, our results provide an approach for estimating bottom roughness and Cd based entirely on remotely sensed data, including their spatial variability, which can improve modeling of river discharge and morphodynamics in data-poor regions.},

Efforts were aimed at testing new methods in an estuarine system and to determine if turbulence created by tidal velocity can be responsible for the short-term variability in k. Measurements were made during a low wind day, at a site with tidal excursions of 2.7 m and a range in tidal velocity of nearly 1 m sϪ1. Estimates of k using the gradient ﬂux technique were made simultaneously with the Controlled Flux Technique (CFT), infrared imagery, and high-resolution turbulence measurements, which measure the surface renewal rate, turbulent scales, and the turbulent dissipation rate, respectively. All measurements were conducted from a small mobile catamaran that minimizes air- and water-side ﬂow distortions. Infrared imagery showed considerable variability in the turbulent scales that affect air-water gas exchange. These measurements were consistent with variation in the surface renewal rate (range 0.02 to 2 sϪ1), the turbulent dissipation rate (range 10Ϫ7 to 10Ϫ5 W kgϪ1), and k (range 2.2 to 12.0 cm hrϪ1). During this low wind day, all variables were shown to correlate with tidal speed. Taken collectively our results indicate the promise of these methods for determining short-term variability in gas transfer and near surface turbulence in estuaries and demonstrate that turbulent transport associated with tidal velocity is a potentially important factor with respect to gas exchange in coastal systems.},

The present study attempts to combine the general outcome of such experiments at both interfaces into a universal scaling relation for the thicknesses of the viscous and diffusive sublayers in terms of the Kolmogorov and Batchelor length scales, respectively. Transfer velocities can then be described in terms of the Schmidt number of the respective tracer and in terms of the turbulence dissipation rate. Applying law-of-the-wall scaling to convert dissipation rates into an appropriate friction velocity estimate results in a mechanistic description of the transfer velocity, which is comparable to common empirical parameterizations. It is hypothesized, however, that the dissipation rate and hence the directly estimated level of turbulence provide a more appropriate variable for the parameterization of interfacial fluxes than wind speed or turbulent friction velocity inferred from law-of-the-wall scaling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Given altimetry measurements, the identification capability of time varying inflow discharge Qin(t) and the Strickler coefficient K (defined as a power-law in h the water depth) of the 1D river Saint–Venant model is investigated. Various altimetry satellite missions provide water level elevation measurements of wide rivers, in particular the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. An original and synthetic reading of all the available information (data, wave propagation and the Manning-Strickler’s law residual) are represented on the so-called identifiability map. The latter provides in the space-time plane a comprehensive overview of the inverse problem features. Inferences based on Variational Data Assimilation (VDA) are investigated at the limit of the data-model inversion capability : relatively short river portions, relatively infrequent observations, that is inverse problems presenting a low identifiability index. The inflow discharge Qin(t) is inferred simultaneously with the varying coefficient K(h). The bed level is either given or inferred from a lower complexity model. The experiments and analysis are conducted for different scenarios (SWOT-like or multi-sensors-like). The scenarios differ by the observation frequency and by the identifiability index. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the observation errors and to the first guess values demonstrate the robustness of the VDA inferences. Finally this study aiming at fusing relatively sparse altimetric data and the 1D Saint–Venant river flow model highlights the spatiotemporal resolution lower limit, also the great potential in terms of discharge inference including for a single river reach.},

	abstract = {Two ideas regarding the structure of turbulence near a clear air-water interface are used to derive a waterside gas transfer velocity kL for sparingly and slightly soluble gases. The first is that kL is proportional to the turnover velocity described by the vertical velocity structure function Dww(r), where r is separation distance between two points. The second is that the scalar exchange between the air-water interface and the waterside turbulence can be suitably described by a length scale proportional to the Batchelor scale lB=ηSc−1/2, where Sc is the molecular Schmidt number and η is the Kolmogorov microscale defining the smallest scale of turbulent eddies impacted by fluid viscosity. Using an approximate solution to the von Kármán-Howarth equation predicting Dww(r) in the inertial and viscous regimes, prior formulations for kL are recovered including (i) , vK is the Kolmogorov velocity defined by the Reynolds number vKη/ν = 1 and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water; (ii) surface divergence formulations; (iii) , where u∗ is the waterside friction velocity; (iv) for Keulegan numbers exceeding a threshold needed for long-wave generation, where the proportionality constant varies with wave age, g is the gravitational acceleration; and (v) in free convection, where qo is the surface heat flux and βo is the thermal expansion of water. The work demonstrates that the aforementioned kL formulations can be recovered from a single structure function model derived for locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence.},

New production values obtained with these analyses of oxygen curves from various sources, as well as a few previously existing estimates of primary production, indicate a generally higher rate of production in flowing waters than in other types of aquatic environments. The ratio of total primary production to total community respiration is used to classify communities quantitatively according to their predominantly heterotrophic or autotrophic characteristics. Longitudinal succession within a stream tends to modify the ratio towards unity from higher values for autotrophic and from lower values for heterotrophic communities. The behavior of this ratio is described for the annual cycle in a stream, for the sequence of pollution recovery, and for diverse types of communities.},

	abstract = {The Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission (SWOT), scheduled for launch in 2021, will deliver two-dimensional observations of water surface heights for lakes, rivers wider than 100 m and oceans. Even though the scientific literature has highlighted several fields of application for the expected products, detailed simulations of the SWOT radar performance for a realistic river scenario have not been presented in the literature. Understanding the error of the most fundamental “raw” SWOT hydrology product is important in order to have a greater awareness about strengths and limits of the forthcoming satellite observations. This study focuses on a reach (∼140 km in length) of the middle-lower portion of the Po River, in Northern Italy, and, to date, represents one of the few real-case analyses of the spatial patterns in water surface elevation accuracy expected from SWOT. The river stretch is characterized by a main channel varying from 100 to 500 m in width and a large floodplain (up to 5 km) delimited by a system of major embankments. The simulation of the water surface along the Po River for different flow conditions (high, low and mean annual flows) is performed with inputs from a quasi-2D model implemented using detailed topographic and bathymetric information (LiDAR, 2 m resolution). By employing a simulator that mimics many SWOT satellite sensor characteristics and generates proxies of the remotely sensed hydrometric data, this study characterizes the spatial observations potentially provided by SWOT. We evaluate SWOT performance under different hydraulic conditions and assess possible effects of river embankments, river width, river topography and distance from the satellite ground track. Despite analyzing errors from the raw radar pixel cloud, which receives minimal processing, the present study highlights the promising potential of this Ka-band interferometer for measuring water surface elevations, with mean elevation errors of 0.1 cm and 21 cm for high and low flows, respectively. Results of the study characterize the expected performance of the upcoming SWOT mission and provide additional insights into potential applications of SWOT observations.},

SWOT observations will enable estimation of river discharge by using simple flow laws such as the Manning-Strickler equation, complementing in-situ streamgages. Several discharge inversion algorithms designed to compute unobserved flow law parameters (e.g. friction coefficient, bathymetry) have been proposed, but to date, a systematic assessment of factors controlling algorithm performance has not been conducted. Here, we assess the performance of the five algorithms that are expected to be used in the construction of the SWOT product. To perform this assessment, we used synthetic SWOT observations created with hydraulic model output corrupted with SWOT-like error. Prior information provided to the algorithms was purposefully limited to an estimate of mean annual flow (MAF), designed to produce a “worst case” benchmark. Prior MAF error was an important control on algorithm performance, but discharge estimates produced by the algorithms are less biased than the MAF; thus, the discharge algorithms improve on the prior. We show for the first time that accuracy and frequency of remote sensing observations are less important than prior bias, hydraulic variability among reaches, and flow law accuracy in governing discharge algorithm performance. The discharge errors and error sensitivities reported herein are a bounding benchmark, representing worst possible expected errors and error sensitivities. This study lays the groundwork to develop predictive power of algorithm performance, and thus map the global distribution of worst-case SWOT discharge accuracy.},

	abstract = {A simple approach, the delta method, is derived to estimate stream reaeration, primary production, and respiration rates on the basis of diurnal dissolved oxygen measurements. The method uses three features of the diurnal curve to determine these quantities. The time of minimum deficit (relative to solar noon) is used to estimate the reaeration rate. Given the reaeration rate, the deficit range Δ is employed to predict photosynthetic production. Finally, the average deficit can be used in conjunction with the reaeration and production rates to compute respiration. A graphical procedure is presented to implement the method. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to the Grand River in Michigan. Although the method has general applicability, a sensitivity analysis indicates that it is particularly effective for streams with lower reaeration rates (i.e., {\textless}1.0d−1{\textless}1.0d-1{\textless}math overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}1.0{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mspace width="0.16em"{\textgreater}{\textless}/mspace{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}d{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}-{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}).

	abstract = {Lay Abstract Air–water gas exchange governs the rate at which atmospheric gases flow into and out of aquatic ecosystems. Knowing this rate is necessary to calculate river photosynthesis and respiration, but there are few data from large rivers, and there are no data that include whitewater rapids. We studied the Colorado River, Grand Canyon; this river has flat reaches separated by extremely large, steep, whitewater rapids. We measured gas transfer velocity (the height of the water column that can exchange all of its gas per hour) by measuring how quickly the river gained oxygen as it flowed over the first 7 major rapids. The Colorado River has low oxygen concentration as it flows out of Glen Canyon Dam, located 25 kilometers upriver from Lees Ferry. We found that gas transfer velocity increased as river slope increased. Gas transfer velocity was low in flat reaches but was up to 800 times higher in rapids, which were the highest rates ever measured in a river. Based on the rate of change of oxygen concentration per meter of river drop, we estimated gas transfer velocity for the remainder of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. Gas exchange varied 5-fold depending on the slope of the immediate reach. Gas transfer velocity was higher for the Colorado River than for other aquatic ecosystems because of its large rapids. Our approach of scaling gas transfer velocity to the entire river will allow comparing gas transfer velocity across rivers that have variable river slopes, such as the Colorado River, Grand Canyon.},

	abstract = {The role of inland waters for the global carbon cycle is now recognized and evidence increasingly suggests that stream ecosystems disproportionately contribute to the carbon cycle. Understanding the dynamics and drivers of stream water partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and CO2 evasion fluxes from streams to the atmosphere is imperative for assessing the role of climate change on the carbon cycle in stream ecosystems. Monitoring pCO2 over 3 years, we here report on the seasonal, diurnal, and event-driven dynamics of pCO2 in the hyporheic zone and stream water of an Alpine stream and assess possible drivers of these dynamics. Our findings suggest that both catchment-derived CO2 delivered by shallow groundwater into the stream and in-stream respiration continuously build up pCO2 in the hyporheic zone. Depending on stream water temperature and assumedly on primary production (inferred from photosynthetically active radiation), hyporheic CO2 contributes to stream water pCO2 and ultimately to CO2 outgassing to the atmosphere. Diurnal patterns of stream water pCO2 increasingly built up during extended base flow and streambed-scouring storms caused the collapse of these diurnal patterns. Post storm recovery of the diurnal pCO2 patterns was generally rapid. Our findings suggest that decreasing gas exchange velocity related to receding discharge drives recovery dynamics. We found that average CO2 outgassing fluxes during night exceeded those during day by up to 1.8 times. Our study highlights temperature and hydrology—key components of climate change—as major drivers of pCO2 dynamics in Alpine streams. They also underscore the necessity to consider day-night differences in CO2 outgassing fluxes to properly establish carbon budgets and regional estimates of CO2 outgassing to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Direct measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were made over a 2-yr period in surface waters of the York River estuary in Virginia. The pCO2 in surface waters exceeded that in the overlying atmosphere, indicating that the estuary was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere at most times and locations. Salinity-based DIC mixing curves indicate there was also an internal source of both DIC and alkalinity, implying net alkalinity generation within the estuary. The DIC and alkalinity source displayed seasonal patterns similar to that of pCO2 and were reproducible over a 2-yr study period. We propose that the source of inorganic carbon necessary for both the sustained CO2 evasion to the atmosphere and the advective export of DIC is respiration in excess of primary production (e.g., net heterotrophy). The rates of CO2 evasion and DIC export were estimated to provide an annual rate of net heterotrophy of 100 g C m−2 yr−1. Approximately 40\% of this excess inorganic carbon production was exported as DIC to the coastal ocean, whereas 60\% was lost as CO2 evasion to the atmosphere. The alkalinity generation needed to sustain the export of inorganic carbon, as HCO3− , is most likely provided by net sulfate reduction in sediments. Accumulation of sulfide in the sediments of a representative site directly adjacent to the York River estuary is sufficient to account for the net export of alkalinity. The seasonality of net heterotrophy causes large variations in annual CO2 and DIC concentrations, and it stresses the need for comprehensive temporal data sets when reporting annual rates of CO2 evasion, DIC advection, and net heterotrophy.},

Results indicate that rarely is there a single best prediction equation in a given velocity-depth region, rather there usually is a group of statistically indistinguishable top-performing equations. Also, no single reaeration equation performed well over all hydraulic conditions. Prediction equations, which include slope as a variable are more accurate and have lower bias than those that do not. However, even the top-performing equations exhibited large prediction errors of at least 40–50\% and exceeded 100\% in some regions. This level of error in predicting reaeration rate coefficients will continue to have a major impact on the uncertainty of dissolved oxygen forecasts from receiving water quality models.},

	abstract = {Boreal streams represent potentially important conduits for the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. The gas transfer coefficient of CO2 (KCO2) is a key variable in estimating this source strength, but the scarcity of measured values in lotic systems creates a risk of incorrect flux estimates even when stream gas concentrations are well known. This study used 114 independent measurements of KCO2 from 14 stream reaches in a boreal headwater system to determine and predict spatiotemporal variability in KCO2. The KCO2 values ranged from 0.001 to 0.207 min−1 across the 14 sites. Median KCO2 for a specific site was positively correlated with the slope of the stream reach, with higher gas transfer coefficients occurring in steeper stream sections. Combining slope with a width/depth index of the stream reach explained 83\% of the spatial variability in KCO2. Temporal variability was more difficult to predict and was strongly site specific. Variation in KCO2, rather than pCO2, was the main determinant of stream CO2 evasion. Applying published generalized gas transfer velocities produced an error of up to 100\% in median instantaneous evasion rates compared to the use of actual measured KCO2 values from our field study. Using the significant relationship to local slope, the median KCO2 was predicted for 300,000 km of watercourses (ranging in stream order 1–4) in the forested landscape of boreal/nemoral Sweden. The range in modeled stream order specific median KCO2 was 0.017–0.028 min−1 and there was a clear gradient of increasing KCO2 with lower stream order. We conclude that accurate regional scale estimates of CO2 evasion fluxes from running waters are possible, but require a good understanding of gas exchange at the water surface.},

Such metabolic measurements offer important opportunities in fundamental and applied research, especially in relating stream metabolic responses to human and other pressures. The accurate determination of the reaeration coefficient is one challenge for making reliable ecological inferences from DO measurements made over many diel periods (i.e., months or years). We outline three methods for calculating atmospheric reaeration but concentrate on the use of statistical estimation to simultaneously estimate reaeration and metabolic rates using Bayesian model fitting. While there are existing programs (ModelMaker and Bayesian Metabolic Model [BaMM]), these are either slow or unable to be used easily for fitting multiple days of metabolic data (one to many months). Our implementation, BAyesian Single-station Estimation (BASE), uses freely available software (R and OpenBUGS), includes a batch mode that can fit data for many days, and provides visual and statistical measures of “goodness-of-fit.” We compare the results of the BASE, ModelMaker, and BaMM programs.},

	abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

	abstract = {Gas exchange across the air–water boundary of streams and rivers is a globally large biogeochemical flux. Gas exchange depends on the solubility of the gas of interest, the gas concentrations of the air and water, and the gas exchange velocity (k), usually normalized to a Schmidt number of 600, referred to as k600. Gas exchange velocity is of intense research interest because it is problematic to estimate, is highly spatially variable, and has high prediction error. Theory dictates that molecular diffusivity and turbulence drives variation in k600 in flowing waters. We measure k600 via several methods from direct measures, gas tracer experiments, to modeling of diel changes in dissolved gas concentrations. Many estimates of k600 show that surface turbulence explains variation in k600 leading to predictive models based upon geomorphic and hydraulic variables. These variables include stream channel slope and stream flow velocity, the product of which, is proportional to the energy dissipation rate in streams and rivers. These empirical models provide understanding of the controls on k600, yet high residual variation in k600 show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations. The most appropriate method to estimate gas exchange depends on the scientific question along with the characteristics of the study sites. We provide a decision tree for selecting the best method to estimate k600 for individual river reaches to scaling to river networks.

	abstract = {River discharge is currently monitored by a diminishing network of gauges, which provide a spatially incomplete picture of global discharges. This study assimilated water level information derived from a fused satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image and digital terrain model (DTM) with simulations from a coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic model to estimate discharge in an un-gauged basin scenario. Assimilating water level measurements led to a 79\% reduction in ensemble discharge uncertainty over the coupled hydrological hydrodynamic model alone. Measurement bias was evident, but the method still provided a means of improving estimates of discharge for high flows. The study demonstrates the potential of currently available synthetic aperture radar imagery to reduce discharge uncertainty in un-gauged basins when combined with model simulations in a data assimilation framework, where sufficient topographic data are available. The work is timely because in the near future the launch of satellite radar missions will lead to a significant increase in the volume of data available for space-borne discharge estimation.

Seasonal patterns of u* and w* were dissimilar; u* was often highest in the spring, while w*increased throughout the summer to a maximum in early fall. Convection was a larger mixed-layer turbulence source than wind shear (u*/w* {\textless} 0.75) for 18 of the 40 lakes, including all 11 lakes {\textless}10 ha. As a consequence, the relative contribution of convection to the gas transfer velocity (k, estimated by the surface renewal model) was greater for small lakes. The average k was 0.54 m day−1 for lakes {\textless}10 ha. Because u* and w*differ in temporal pattern and magnitude across lakes, both convection and wind shear should be considered in future formulations of lake-air gas exchange, especially for small lakes.},

CO2 is typically supersaturated in streams because rates of organic matter decomposition exceed photosynthetic uptake, and because of inflow of CO2 supersaturated ground waters. Using the U.S. Geological Survey's NASQAN database, we calculated pCO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in 417 streams and rivers distributed across the contiguous United States over a 22-year period. In addition to demonstrating widespread supersaturation and distinct regional variation in pCO2 across the U.S., our analysis revealed that pCO2 significantly declined 78.4 ppmv y−1 from 1973 to 1994. This decline is not attributable to changes in terrestrial weathering or in-stream processes, but instead suggests large-scale declines in terrestrial CO2 production and import into aquatic ecosystems during this 22-year period.},

	abstract = {An inverse method to estimate the discharge of rivers observed by satellite altimetry is developed and assessed. The flow model relies on the Saint-Venant equations combined with a dedicated algebraic system. The resulting hierarchical flow model combined with variational data assimilation enables estimation of the key unknown flow features: the discharge Q(x,t), an effective bathymetry b(x) and friction coefficients K(x). Numerical results are analyzed for three rivers in two different observation contexts (corresponding to the SWOT Cal-Val orbit and to the SWOT nominal orbit) and three different scenarios of prior information availability. These investigations cover numerous realistic worldwide applications. It is shown that the space-time variations of the river discharge Q(x, t) and the bathymetry profile b(x) can be accurately inferred. However the inferred values of Q may be obtained at a multiplicative factor only (a bias). This bias vanishes as soon as an accurate mean value or one reference value of one of the three inferred field is provided. Once the assimilation of the satellite measurements has been done during a sufficiently long time period representing enough flow variability (one year), the low complexity algebraic flow model provides discharge estimations in real computational time from newly acquired measurements.},

	abstract = {AbstractRemote sensing has gained attention as a novel source of primary information for estimating river discharge, and the Mass conserved Flow Law Inversion (McFLI) approach has successfully estimated river discharge in ungauged basins solely from optical satellite data. However, McFLI currently suffers from two major drawbacks: 1) Existing optical satellites lead to temporally and spatially sparse discharge estimates, and 2) because of the assumptions required, McFLI cannot guarantee downstream flow continuity. Hydrological modeling has neither drawback, yet model accuracy is frequently limited by a lack of discharge observations. We therefore combine McFLI and models in a data assimilation framework applicable globally. We establish a daily “ungauged” baseline model for 28,998 reaches of the Missouri river basin forced by recently published global runoff data, which we do not calibrate. We estimate discharge via McFLI using ∼1 million width measurements made from 12,000 Landsat scenes and assimilate McFLI into the model before validating at 403 USGS gauges. Results show that assimilated discharges did not impair already accurate baseline flows and achieved median improvements of 28\% Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), 0.50 Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and 0.23 Kling Gupta Efficiency (KGE) where baseline performance was poor (defined as baseline negative NSE, 225/403 reaches). We ultimately improved flows at 92\% of these originally poorly modelled gauges, even though Landsat images only provide McFLI discharges at 1.5\% of reaches and 26\% of simulated days. Our results suggest that the combination of McFLI and state-of-the-art hydrology models can improve flow estimations in ungauged basins globally.This article is protected by copyright.

Daily integrals of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration were measured for 447 d between May 1992 and November 1994 based on single station diel oxygen curves. In 1993 gross primary production averaged 2.5 g O$_{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{-2}}$d$^{\textrm{-1}}$ and ecosystem respiration averaged 3.5 g O$_{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{-2}}$d$^{\textrm{-1}}$ (maximum daily rates observed in summer were 12.6 and 11.7 g O$_{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{-2}}$d$^{\textrm{-1}}$). During the investigation, 32 bed-moving spates (peak discharge {\textgreater}28 m$^{\textrm{3}}$/s) occurred. Bed-moving spates distinctly depressed primary production and ecosystem respiration. Spates shifted ecosystem metabolism toward heterotrophy (decreased P/R) because gross primary production was more affected than ecosystem respiration. Recovery rates of gross primary production were high in summer and low in winter. Recovery of ecosystem respiration showed less distinct seasonal variation. Energy flow through the system was calculated as the sum of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. Upper (maximum energy flow) and lower (resistant energy flow) boundaries were estimated, within which energy flow varied. The ratio of maximum to resistant energy flow, which ranged from 6.1 to 9.6, indicated that resistance to spates was small, at least after extended periods free of spates (5-8 wk).},

We test this model using simulated data with realistic measurement errors to demonstrate that it accurately estimates the model parameters and that parameter uncertainties correctly scale with error in the observations and number of data points. Application of the model to field data from two productive stream ecosystems with substantial daily dissolved oxygen variation quantified the underlying physical and biological factors that control oxygen dynamics in these ecosystems and provided empirical support for a light saturation model of the photosynthesis-irradiance relationships at the ecosystem scale. Although inclusion of δ18O-O2 provides a second oxygen budget, analysis of field data shows that metabolic and reaeration parameters can be accurately estimated by modeling the transient dynamics of dissolved oxygen concentration alone in relation to daily changes in water temperature and light regime. This model is particularly suited to low-gas exchange, high-productivity systems, which have thus far proved challenging to measure ecosystem metabolism accurately. The modeling framework is applicable to single-station, open-system experimental designs and provides a rigorous and generalizable framework for estimating ecosystem metabolism in aquatic ecosystems.},

We also compared this dataset of {\textgreater}40,000 pCO2 records with other published records from lotic systems. Individual stream sites exhibited relatively distinct pCO2 patterns over time with few consistent traits across sites. Some sites showed strong diel variability, some exhibited increasing pCO2 with increasing discharge, whereas other streams had reduced pCO2 with increasing discharge or no clear response to changes in flow. The only “universal” signature observed in headwater streams was a late summer pCO2 maxima that was likely driven by greatest rates of organic matter respiration due to highest annual temperatures. However, we did not observe this seasonal pattern in a southern hardwood forest site, likely because the region was transitioning from a severe drought. This work clearly illustrates the heterogeneous nature of headwater streams, and highlights the idiosyncratic nature of a non-conservative solute that is jointly influenced by physics, hydrology, and biology. We suggest that future researchers carefully select sensor locations (within and among streams) and provide additional contextual information when attempting to explain pCO2 patterns.},
