  abstract = {Aquatic primary productivity produces oxygen (O2) and consumes carbon dioxide (CO2) in a ratio of 1.2. However, in aquatic ecosystems, dissolved CO2 concentrations can be low, potentially limiting primary productivity. Here, results show that a large drainage basin maintains its highest levels of gross primary productivity (GPP) when dissolved CO2 is diminished or undetectable due to photosynthetic uptake. Data show that, after CO2 is depleted, bicarbonate, an ionized form of inorganic carbon, supports these high levels of productivity. In fact, outputs from a process-based model suggest that bicarbonate can support up to 58\% of GPP under the most productive conditions. This is the first evidence that high levels of aquatic GPP are sustained in a riverine drainage network despite CO2 depletion, which has implications for freshwater ecology, biogeochemistry, and isotopic analysis.},

  abstract = {Outgassing of carbon dioxide (CO2) from rivers and streams to the atmosphere is a major loss term in the coupled terrestrial-aquatic carbon cycle of major low-gradient river systems (the term ``river system'' encompasses the rivers and streams of all sizes that compose the drainage network in a river basin). However, the magnitude and controls on this important carbon flux are not well quantified. We measured carbon dioxide flux rates (FCO2), gas transfer velocity (k), and partial pressures (pCO2) in rivers and streams of the Amazon and Mekong river systems in South America and Southeast Asia, respectively. FCO2 and k values were significantly higher in small rivers and streams (channels {$<$}100 m wide) than in large rivers (channels {$>$}100 m wide). Small rivers and streams also had substantially higher variability in k values than large rivers. Observed FCO2 and k values suggest that previous estimates of basinwide CO2 evasion from tropical rivers and wetlands have been conservative and are likely to be revised upward substantially in the future. Data from the present study combined with data compiled from the literature collectively suggest that the physical control of gas exchange velocities and fluxes in low-gradient river systems makes a transition from the dominance of wind control at the largest spatial scales (in estuaries and river mainstems) toward increasing importance of water current velocity and depth at progressively smaller channel dimensions upstream. These results highlight the importance of incorporating scale-appropriate k values into basinwide models of whole ecosystem carbon balance.},

  abstract = {The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission expected to launch in 2021 will offer a unique opportunity to map river discharge at an unprecedented spatial resolution globally from observations of water surface elevation, width, and slope. Because river discharge will not be directly observed from SWOT, a number of algorithms of varying complexity have been developed to estimate discharge from SWOT observables. Outstanding issues include the lack of accurate prior information and parameter equifinality. We developed a new data assimilation discharge algorithm that aimed to overcome these limitations by integrating a data-driven approach to estimate priors with a model informed by hydraulic geometry relations. A comprehensive simulated dataset of 18 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithm and four different configurations (rectangular channel, generic channel, and geomorphologically classified channel with and without regularization) to assess the impact of progressively adding hydraulic geometry constraints to the estimation problem. The algorithm with the full set of constraints outperformed the other configurations with median Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.77, compared with -0.46, 0.31 and 0.66, while other error metrics showed similar improvement. Results from this study show the promise of this hybrid data-driven approach to estimating river discharge from SWOT observations, although a number of enhancements need to be tested to improve the operational applicability of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

  abstract = {The emission of biogenic gases from large rivers can be an important component of regional greenhouse gas budgets. However, emission rate estimates are often poorly constrained due to uncertainties in the air-water gas exchange rate. We used the floating chamber method to estimate the gas transfer velocity (k) of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Markland Pool of the Ohio River, a large tributary of the Mississippi River (U.S.A). We measured k every two weeks for a year at one site and at 15 additional sites distributed across the length of the pool during two summer surveys. We found that k was positively related to both water currents and wind speeds, with 46\% of the gas transfer attributable to water currents at low wind speeds (e.g., 0.5 m s-1) and 11\% at higher wind speeds (e.g., {$>$}2.0 m s-1). Gas transfer velocity was highly sensitive to wind, possibly because the direction of river flow was often directly opposed to the wind direction. Gas transfer velocity values derived for CH4 were consistently greater than those derived for CO2 when standardized to a Schmidt number of 600 (k600), possibly because the transfer of CH4, a poorly soluble gas, was enhanced by surfacing microbubbles. Additional research to determine the conditions that support microbubble enhanced gas transfer is merited.},

In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in space, and many river basins and most lakes\textemdash especially in the developing world and in sparsely populated regions\textemdash remain unmonitored. Satellite remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes. This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d'\'Etudes Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date. Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and hydrology models. A smaller number of studies have also addressed methods for computation of lake and reservoir storage change or have quantified improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.},

Water-surface width and maximum channel width measured from 26 aerial and digital orthophotos of 17 single channel rivers and 41 SAR images of three braided rivers were coupled with channel slope data obtained from topographic maps to estimate the discharge. The standard error of the discharge estimates were within a factor of 1.5\textendash 2 (50\textendash 100\%) of the observed, with the mean estimate accuracy within 10\%. This level of accuracy was achieved using calibration functions developed from observed discharge. The calibration functions use reach specific geomorphic variables, the maximum channel width and the channel slope, to predict a correction factor. The calibration functions are related to channel type. Surface velocity and width information, obtained from a single C-band image obtained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) AirSAR was also used to estimate discharge for a reach of the Missouri River. Without using a calibration function, the estimate accuracy was +72\% of the observed discharge, which is within the expected range of uncertainty for the method. However, using the observed velocity to calibrate the initial estimate improved the estimate accuracy to within +10\% of the observed. Remotely sensed discharge estimates with accuracies reported in this paper could be useful for regional or continental scale hydrologic studies, or in regions where ground-based data is lacking.},

Here we report dissolved carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations from 12 rivers in sub-Saharan Africa, including seasonally resolved sampling at 39 sites, acquired between 2006 and 2014. Fluxes were calculated from published gas transfer velocities, and upscaled to the area of all sub-Saharan African rivers using available spatial data sets. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from river channels alone were about 0.4 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to two-thirds of the overall net carbon land sink previously reported for Africa. Including emissions from wetlands of the Congo river increases the total carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse-gas emissions to about 0.9 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to about one quarter of the global ocean and terrestrial combined carbon sink. Riverine carbon dioxide and methane emissions increase with wetland extent and upland biomass. We therefore suggest that future changes in wetland and upland cover could strongly affect greenhouse-gas emissions from African inland waters.},

The gas transfer velocity is well correlated to wind speed and a simple linear regression function gives the most consistent fit to the data. Based on water current measurements, we estimated the contribution of water current induced turbulence to the gas transfer velocity, using the conceptual relationship of O'Connor and Dobbins (1958). This allowed us to construct an empirical relationship to compute the gas transfer velocity of CO2 that accounts for the contribution of wind and water current. Based on this relationship, the spatial and temporal variability of the gas transfer velocity in the Scheldt estuary was investigated. Water currents contribute significantly to the gas transfer velocity, but the spatial and temporal variability (from daily to seasonal scales) is mainly related to wind speed variability.},

Using a strategy first developed for wide-area optical sensors, and in conjunction with even limited ground-based discharge information, such microwave data can be used to estimate river discharge changes, river ice status, and watershed runoff. Water surface area in a river reach increases as flow widens, and any temporally calibrated observation sensitive to changing water area monitors discharge. The sensor spatial resolution is less important than the scene-to-scene calibration and the contrast in upwelling radiance between water and land. We use the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) band at 36.5 GHz, descending orbit, horizontal polarization, and the resampled Level-3 daily global data product. The discharge estimator HR is a ratio of calibration-target radiance (expressed as brightness temperature), for a local land parcel unaffected by the river, to measurement-target brightness temperature, for a pixel centered over the river. At midlatitudes, pixel dimensions are approximately 25 km. Because of low emission from water surfaces, HR increases with discharge as in-pixel water area expands. It increases sharply once overbank flow conditions occur. River ice-cover is also detectable. The sensitivity and accuracy of the orbital measurements is tested along U.S. rivers monitored by in situ gaging stations, with favorable results. Other tests demonstrate that for seasonally variable rivers, AMSR-E can provide useful international measurements of daily river discharge even if only fragmentary monthly mean discharge data are available for calibration.},

Here, we demonstrate a relationship between bed roughness and water surface turbulence that can be used to make remote estimates of Cd. We observe that regions with larger bed roughness result in greater turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which is transported upward by river boils to the water surface. We present a relationship between surface TKE and Cd, and validate this relationship by comparing remotely sensed estimates of Cd to those from in situ measurements. Thus, our results provide an approach for estimating bottom roughness and Cd based entirely on remotely sensed data, including their spatial variability, which can improve modeling of river discharge and morphodynamics in data-poor regions.},

Existing discharge methods rely on ``prior river knowledge'' to infer parameters not directly measured from space. Here, we show that discharge estimation is improved by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics. Using over 370,000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data, we test unsupervised learning and an ``expert'' method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing. This intervention, along with updates to model physics, constitutes a new method we term ``geoBAM,'' an update of the Bayesian At-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning's (BAM) algorithm. We tested geoBAM on Landsat imagery over more than 7,500 rivers (108 are gauged) in Canada's Mackenzie River basin and on simulated hydraulic data for 19 rivers that mimic SWOT observations without measurement error. geoBAM yielded considerable improvement over BAM, improving the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the Mackenzie River from -0.05 to 0.26 and from 0.16 to 0.46 for the SWOT rivers. Further, NSE improved by at least 0.10 in 78/108 gauged Mackenzie rivers and 8/19 SWOT rivers. We attribute geoBAM improvement to parameterizing rivers by type rather than globally, but prediction accuracy worsens if parameters are misassigned. This method is easily mapped to rivers at the global scale and paves the way for improving future discharge estimates, especially when coupled with hydrologic models.},

  abstract = {Lakes are central components of the inland water system distinct from, yet inextricably connected to, river networks. Currently, existing network-scale biogeochemistry research, although robust, typically treats each of these components separately or reductively. Here, we incorporate lake morphometry into a fully connected stream/lake network for the Connecticut River watershed and model potential evasion of terrestrially sourced headwater CO2 as transported through the network, ignoring in-stream production. We found that approximately 25\%\textendash 30\% of total potential soil CO2 evasion occurs in lakes, and percent evasion is inversely related to streamflow. A lake's ability to evade CO2 is controlled by residence time and size: most lakes with residence time over 7 days or surface area greater than 0.004 km2 evade functionally all terrestrial CO2 entering from upstream, precluding further downstream transport. We conclude that lakes are important for soil CO2 degassing and that this coupled river/lake approach is promising for CO2 studies henceforth.},

Here we present evidence, using United States Geological Survey field measurements of channel hydraulics for 155 rivers, that AMHG can be hydraulically and geomorphically reconciled with AHG. Our results indicate that AMHG is rightly understood as an expression of a river-wide model of hydraulics driven by changes in slope imposed upon AHG physics. The explanatory power of AHG and this river-wide model combine to determine whether AMHG exists: if both AHG and the river-wide model adequately describe hydraulics, then we show that AMHG is a necessary mathematical consequence of these two phenomena. We also orient these findings in the context of river discharge estimation and other applications.},

Various altimetry satellite missions provide water level elevation measurements of wide rivers, in particular the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. An original and synthetic reading of all the available information (data, wave propagation and the Manning-Strickler's law residual) are represented on the so-called identifiability map. The latter provides in the space-time plane a comprehensive overview of the inverse problem features. Inferences based on Variational Data Assimilation (VDA) are investigated at the limit of the data-model inversion capability : relatively short river portions, relatively infrequent observations, that is inverse problems presenting a low identifiability index. The inflow discharge Qin(t) is inferred simultaneously with the varying coefficient K(h). The bed level is either given or inferred from a lower complexity model. The experiments and analysis are conducted for different scenarios (SWOT-like or multi-sensors-like). The scenarios differ by the observation frequency and by the identifiability index. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the observation errors and to the first guess values demonstrate the robustness of the VDA inferences. Finally this study aiming at fusing relatively sparse altimetric data and the 1D Saint\textendash Venant river flow model highlights the spatiotemporal resolution lower limit, also the great potential in terms of discharge inference including for a single river reach.},

To characterize the uncertainty across existing modeling and satellite approaches, the authors present ensembles of historic monthly global continental discharge estimates that enforce water mass balance over land and ocean. The authors combine independent measurements of ocean\textendash landmass change from altimetry and GRACE with multiple estimates of evaporation minus precipitation (E - P) from remote sensing and reanalysis data to compute 28 time series of global discharge. Results reveal agreement in mass budget across approaches but a large spread in global E - P estimates that propagates into the discharge estimates. It is found that discharges with reanalysis-based E - P provide a closer comparison with current observation-based estimates. After combining GRACE- and altimetry-based mass change estimates with moisture convergences from reanalysis, the total annual mean continental discharge into the oceans is 38 550 {$\pm$} 4800 km3 yr-1. Last, the authors provide continent-wise discharge estimates from GRACE and moisture convergences over land, compare them to other studies, and discuss implications for ocean modeling.},

  abstract = {A simple approach, the delta method, is derived to estimate stream reaeration, primary production, and respiration rates on the basis of diurnal dissolved oxygen measurements. The method uses three features of the diurnal curve to determine these quantities. The time of minimum deficit (relative to solar noon) is used to estimate the reaeration rate. Given the reaeration rate, the deficit range {$\Delta$} is employed to predict photosynthetic production. Finally, the average deficit can be used in conjunction with the reaeration and production rates to compute respiration. A graphical procedure is presented to implement the method. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to the Grand River in Michigan. Although the method has general applicability, a sensitivity analysis indicates that it is particularly effective for streams with lower reaeration rates (i.e., {$<$}1.0d-1{$<$}1.0d-1{$<$}math overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>\&$}lt;{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}1.0{$<$}/mn{$><$}mspace width="0.16em"{$><$}/mspace{$><$}msup{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo{$>$}-{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}).

  abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9~Pg~C~y-1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9~Pg~y-1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

The exponents are shown to depend only on the depth exponent in the hydraulic relation (p) and the exponent that reflects the form of the cross-section (r). The coefficients depend on p and r, but also on the slope exponent in the generalized hydraulic relation and on the physical characteristics of the section: bankfull width, bankfull maximum depth, hydraulic conductance, and slope. The theoretical ranges of coefficient and exponent values derived herein are generally consistent with the averages and individual observed values reported in previous studies. However, observed values of the exponents at particular cross-sections commonly fall outside the theoretical ranges. In particular, the observed value of the velocity exponent m is commonly greater than the theoretical value, suggesting that hydraulic conductance often increases more strongly with discharge than predicted by the assumed hydraulic relations. The developments presented here provide new theoretical insight into the ways in which hydraulic and geometric factors determine hydraulic geometry. This insight should help to explain the variation of at-a-station hydraulic geometry and may facilitate prediction of hydraulic geometry at river reaches where detailed measurements are unavailable.},

Even though the scientific literature has highlighted several fields of application for the expected products, detailed simulations of the SWOT radar performance for a realistic river scenario have not been presented in the literature. Understanding the error of the most fundamental ``raw'' SWOT hydrology product is important in order to have a greater awareness about strengths and limits of the forthcoming satellite observations. This study focuses on a reach ({$\sim$}140 km in length) of the middle-lower portion of the Po River, in Northern Italy, and, to date, represents one of the few real-case analyses of the spatial patterns in water surface elevation accuracy expected from SWOT. The river stretch is characterized by a main channel varying from 100 to 500 m in width and a large floodplain (up to 5 km) delimited by a system of major embankments. The simulation of the water surface along the Po River for different flow conditions (high, low and mean annual flows) is performed with inputs from a quasi-2D model implemented using detailed topographic and bathymetric information (LiDAR, 2 m resolution). By employing a simulator that mimics many SWOT satellite sensor characteristics and generates proxies of the remotely sensed hydrometric data, this study characterizes the spatial observations potentially provided by SWOT. We evaluate SWOT performance under different hydraulic conditions and assess possible effects of river embankments, river width, river topography and distance from the satellite ground track. Despite analyzing errors from the raw radar pixel cloud, which receives minimal processing, the present study highlights the promising potential of this Ka-band interferometer for measuring water surface elevations, with mean elevation errors of 0.1 cm and 21 cm for high and low flows, respectively. Results of the study characterize the expected performance of the upcoming SWOT mission and provide additional insights into potential applications of SWOT observations.},

This algorithm has potential application to river h and S measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. The algorithm was tested using in situ data as a proxy for satellite measurements along a 22.4km reach of the River Severn, UK. First, the algorithm was run with gage measurements of h and S during a small, in-bank event in June 2007. Second, the algorithm was run with measurements of h and S estimated from four remote sensing images during a major out-of-bank flood event in July 2007. River width was assumed to be known for both events. Algorithm-derived estimates of river bathymetry were validated using in situ measurements, and estimates of roughness coefficient were compared to those used in an operational hydraulic model. Algorithm-derived estimates of river discharge were evaluated using gaged discharge. For the in-bank event, when lateral inflows from smaller tributaries were assumed to be known, the method provided an accurate discharge estimate (10\% RMSE). When lateral inflows were assumed unknown, discharge RMSE increased to 36\%. Finally, if just one of the three river reaches was assumed to be have known bathymetry, solutions for bathymetry, roughness and discharge for all three reaches were accurately retrieved, with a corresponding discharge RMSE of 15.6\%. For the out-of-bank flood event, the lateral inflows were unknown, and the final discharge RMSE was 19\%. These results suggest that it should be possible to estimate river discharge via SWOT observations of river water surface elevation, slope and width.},

  abstract = {Water surface elevation (WSE), slope and width measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will enable spaceborne estimates of global river discharge. WSE will be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). InSAR measurements are vulnerable to contamination from layover, a phenomenon wherein radar returns from multiple locations arrive at the sensor simultaneously, rendering them indistinguishable. This study assesses whether layover will significantly impact the precision of SWOT estimates of global river discharge. We present a theoretical river layover uncertainty model at the scale of nodes and reaches, which constitute nominal 200~m and 10~km averages, respectively, along river centerlines. The model is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of SWOT radar interaction with topography covering a total of 41,233 node observations, across a wide range of near-river topographic features. We find that height uncertainty increases to a maximum value at relatively low values of topographic standard deviation and varies strongly with position in the swath. When applied at global scale, the calibrated model shows that layover causes expected height uncertainty to increase by only a modest amount (from 9.4 to 10.4~cm at the 68th percentile). The 68th percentile of the slope uncertainty increases more significantly, from 10 to 17~mm/km. Nonetheless, the 68th percentile discharge uncertainty increases only marginally. We find that the impact of layover on SWOT river discharge is expected to be small in most environments.},

In advance of this launch, we here evaluated the possibility of estimating discharge in ungauged rivers using synthetic, daily ``remote sensing'' measurements derived from hydraulic models corrupted with minimal observational errors. Five discharge algorithms were evaluated, as well as the median of the five, for 19 rivers spanning a range of hydraulic and geomorphic conditions. Reliance upon a priori information, and thus applicability to truly ungauged reaches, varied among algorithms: one algorithm employed only global limits on velocity and depth, while the other algorithms relied on globally available prior estimates of discharge. We found at least one algorithm able to estimate instantaneous discharge to within 35\% relative root-mean-squared error (RRMSE) on 14/16 nonbraided rivers despite out-of-bank flows, multichannel planforms, and backwater effects. Moreover, we found RRMSE was often dominated by bias; the median standard deviation of relative residuals across the 16 nonbraided rivers was only 12.5\%. SWOT discharge algorithm progress is therefore encouraging, yet future efforts should consider incorporating ancillary data or multialgorithm synergy to improve results.},

  abstract = {The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will measure water surface heights and widths for rivers wider than 100 m. At its native resolution, SWOT height errors are expected to be on the order of meters, which prevent the calculation of water surface slopes and the use of slope-dependent discharge equations. To mitigate height and width errors, the high-resolution measurements will be grouped into reaches ({$\sim$}5 to 15 km), where slope and discharge are estimated. We describe three automated river segmentation strategies for defining optimum reaches for discharge estimation: (1) arbitrary lengths, (2) identification of hydraulic controls, and (3) sinuosity. We test our methodologies on 9 and 14 simulated SWOT overpasses over the Sacramento and the Po Rivers, respectively, which we compare against hydraulic models of each river. Our results show that generally, height, width, and slope errors decrease with increasing reach length. However, the hydraulic controls and the sinuosity methods led to better slopes and often height errors that were either smaller or comparable to those of arbitrary reaches of compatible sizes. Estimated discharge errors caused by the propagation of height, width, and slope errors through the discharge equation were often smaller for sinuosity (on average 8.5\% for the Sacramento and 6.9\% for the Po) and hydraulic control (Sacramento: 7.3\% and Po: 5.9\%) reaches than for arbitrary reaches of comparable lengths (Sacramento: 8.6\% and Po: 7.8\%). This analysis suggests that reach definition methods that preserve the hydraulic properties of the river network may lead to better discharge estimates.},

  abstract = {The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will measure river width, water surface elevation, and slope for rivers wider than 50-100 m. SWOT observations will enable estimation of river discharge by using simple flow laws such as the Manning-Strickler equation, complementing in-situ streamgages. Several discharge inversion algorithms designed to compute unobserved flow law parameters (e.g. friction coefficient, bathymetry) have been proposed, but to date, a systematic assessment of factors controlling algorithm performance has not been conducted. Here, we assess the performance of the five algorithms that are expected to be used in the construction of the SWOT product. To perform this assessment, we used synthetic SWOT observations created with hydraulic model output corrupted with SWOT-like error. Prior information provided to the algorithms was purposefully limited to an estimate of mean annual flow (MAF), designed to produce a ``worst case'' benchmark. Prior MAF error was an important control on algorithm performance, but discharge estimates produced by the algorithms are less biased than the MAF; thus, the discharge algorithms improve on the prior. We show for the first time that accuracy and frequency of remote sensing observations are less important than prior bias, hydraulic variability among reaches, and flow law accuracy in governing discharge algorithm performance. The discharge errors and error sensitivities reported herein are a bounding benchmark, representing worst possible expected errors and error sensitivities. This study lays the groundwork to develop predictive power of algorithm performance, and thus map the global distribution of worst-case SWOT discharge accuracy.},

  abstract = {The future SWOT mission (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) will provide cartographic measurements of inland water surfaces (elevation, widths and slope) at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Given synthetic SWOT like data, forward flow models of hierarchical-complexity are revisited and few inverse formulations are derived and assessed for retrieving the river low flow bathymetry, roughness and discharge (A0,K,Q). The concept of an effective low flow bathymetry A0 (the real one being never observed) and roughness K, hence an effective river dynamics description, is introduced. The few inverse models elaborated for inferring (A0,K,Q) are analyzed in two contexts: (1) only remotely sensed observations of the water surface (surface elevation, width and slope) are available; (2) one additional water depth measurement (or estimate) is available. The inverse models elaborated are independent of data acquisition dynamics; they are assessed on 91 synthetic test cases sampling a wide range of steady-state river flows (the Froude number varying between 0.05 and 0.5 for 1km reaches) and in the case of a flood on the Garonne River (France) characterized by large spatio-temporal variabilities. It is demonstrated that the most complete shallow-water like model allowing to separate the roughness and bathymetry terms is the so-called low Froude model. In Case (1), the resulting RMSE on infered discharges are on the order of 15\% for first guess errors larger than 50\%. An important feature of the present inverse methods is the fairly good accuracy of the discharge Q obtained, while the identified roughness coefficient K includes the measurement errors and the misfit of physics between the real flow and the hypothesis on which the inverse models rely; the later neglecting the unobserved temporal variations of the flow and the inertia effects. A compensation phenomena between the indentifiedvalues of K and the unobserved bathymetry A0 is highlighted, while the present inverse models lead to an effective river dynamics model that is accurate in the range of the discharge variability observed. In Case (2), the effective bathymetry profile for 80km of the Garonne River is retrieved with 1\% relative error only. Next, accurate effective topography-friction pairs and also discharge can be inferred. Finally, defining river reaches from the observation grid tends to average the river properties in each reach, hence tends to smooth the hydraulic variability.},

  abstract = {Multi-satellite sensing of continental water surfaces (WS) represents an unprecedented and increasing potential for studying ungauged hydrological and hydraulic processes from their signatures, especially on complex flow zones such as anabranching rivers. However the estimation of discharge from WS observations only is a very challenging, ill-posed, inverse problem due to unknown bathymetry and friction in ungauged rivers, measurements nature, quality and spatio-temporal resolutions regarding the flow (model) scales. This paper proposes an effective 1D hydraulic modeling approach of sufficient complexity to describe anabranching river flows from sparse multisatellite observations using the HiVDI inverse method presented in Larnier et al. (2019) with an augmented control vector including a spatially distributed friction law K(x,h) depending on the flow depth h. It is shown on 71 km of the Xingu River (anabranching, Amazon basin) with altimetric water height timeseries that a fairly accurate upstream discharge hydrograph and effective patterns of channel bathymetry and friction can be inferred simultaneously. The coherence between the sparse observation grid and the fine hydraulic model grid is ensured in the optimization process by imposing a piecewise linear bathymetry profile b(x), which is consistent with the hydraulic visibility ofWS signatures (Garambois et al., 2017; Montazem et al., 2019). The discharge hydrograph Q(t) at observation times and effective bathymetry-friction b(x),K(x,h) patterns are retrieved from 8 years of satellite altimetry (ENVISAT) at 6 virtual stations (VS) along flow. Next, the potential of the forthcoming SWOT data, dense in space, is highlighted by inferring a discharge hydrograph and dense patterns of effective river bathymetry and friction; a physically consistent scaling of friction by reaches enables to consider more dense bathymetry controls. Finally a numerical analysis shows: (i) the importance of an unbiased prior information in the inference of a triplet Q,b(x),K(x,h) from WS observations; (ii) the clear signatures of river bottom slope break in low flows and width variations in high flows, through the analysis of the friction slope term, which is consistent with the findings of Montazem et al. (2019) from WS curvature analysis.},

The practical utility of HG for discharge monitoring, habitat studies, and understanding geomorphic change over time is unquestioned, but its elevation beyond empirically observed relationship to physical principle is not complete, despite universal acceptance of its existence. This review summarizes six decades of HG research while surveying rational, extremal, and empirical attempts to derive HG's underlying physical principles. In addition, so called non-Leopoldian forms of HG are discussed, expanding HG beyond its original construction to examine a range of research that invokes HG in novel ways. The recent discovery of at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) is also discussed in the context of previous HG literature. Finally, some common themes linking disparate HG research communities are described in conjunction with suggestions for possible new directions for HG research in the future.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of river discharge (RSQ) is a burgeoning field rife with innovation. This innovation has resulted in a highly non-cohesive subfield of hydrology advancing at a rapid pace, and as a result misconceptions, mis-citations, and confusion are apparent among authors, readers, editors, and reviewers. While the intellectually diverse subfield of RSQ practitioners can parse this confusion, the broader hydrology community views RSQ as a monolith and such confusion can be damaging. RSQ has not been comprehensively summarized over the past decade, and we believe that a summary of the recent literature has a potential to provide clarity to practitioners and general hydrologists alike. Therefore, we here summarize a broad swath of the literature, and find after our reading that the most appropriate way to summarize this literature is first by application area (into methods appropriate for gauged, semi-gauged, regionally gauged, politically ungauged, and totally ungauged basins) and next by methodology. We do not find categorizing by sensor useful, and everything from un-crewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to satellites are considered here. Perhaps the most cogent theme to emerge from our reading is the need for context. All RSQ is employed in the service of furthering hydrologic understanding, and we argue that nearly all RSQ is useful in this pursuit provided it is properly contextualized. We argue that if authors place each new work into the correct application context, much confusion can be avoided, and we suggest a framework for such context here. Specifically, we define which RSQ techniques are and are not appropriate for ungauged basins, and further define what it means to be `ungauged' in the context of RSQ. We also include political and economic realities of RSQ, as the objective of the field is sometimes to provide data purposefully cloistered by specific political decisions. This framing can enable RSQ to respond to hydrology at large with confidence and cohesion even in the face of methodological and application diversity evident within the literature. Finally, we embrace the intellectual diversity of RSQ and suggest the field is best served by a continuation of methodological proliferation rather than by a move toward orthodoxy and standardization.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of river discharge is critically important for water resource management, climate modeling, and improved understanding of the global water cycle, yet discharge is poorly known in much of the world. Remote sensing holds promise to mitigate this gap, yet current approaches for quantitative retrievals of river discharge require in situ calibration or a priori knowledge of river hydraulics, limiting their utility in unmonitored regions. Recently, Gleason and Smith (2014) demonstrated discharge retrievals within 20\textendash 30\% of in situ observations solely from Landsat TM satellite images through discovery of a river-specific geomorphic scaling phenomenon termed at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG). This paper advances the AMHG discharge retrieval approach via additional parameter optimizations and validation on 34 gauged rivers spanning a diverse range of geomorphic and climatic settings. Sensitivity experiments reveal that discharge retrieval accuracy varies with river morphology, reach averaging procedure, and optimization parameters. Quality of remotely sensed river flow widths is also important. Recommended best practices include a proposed global parameter set for use when a priori information is unavailable. Using this global parameterization, AMHG discharge retrievals are successful for most investigated river morphologies (median RRMSE 33\% of in situ gauge observations), except braided rivers (median RRMSE 74\%), rivers having low at-a-station hydraulic geometry b exponents (reach-averaged b {$<$} 0.1, median RRMSE 86\%), and arid rivers having extreme discharge variability (median RRMSE {$>$} 1000\%). Excluding such environments, 26\textendash 41\% RRMSE agreement between AMHG discharge retrievals and in situ gauge observations suggests AMHG can meaningfully address global discharge knowledge gaps solely from repeat satellite imagery.},

Such metabolic measurements offer important opportunities in fundamental and applied research, especially in relating stream metabolic responses to human and other pressures. The accurate determination of the reaeration coefficient is one challenge for making reliable ecological inferences from DO measurements made over many diel periods (i.e., months or years). We outline three methods for calculating atmospheric reaeration but concentrate on the use of statistical estimation to simultaneously estimate reaeration and metabolic rates using Bayesian model fitting. While there are existing programs (ModelMaker and Bayesian Metabolic Model [BaMM]), these are either slow or unable to be used easily for fitting multiple days of metabolic data (one to many months). Our implementation, BAyesian Single-station Estimation (BASE), uses freely available software (R and OpenBUGS), includes a batch mode that can fit data for many days, and provides visual and statistical measures of ``goodness-of-fit.''

This effect is an important moderator of climate change, but can we count on it to remain as strong in the future? Gruber et al. calculated the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 for the interval from 1994 to 2007, which continued as expected. They also observed clear regional deviations from this pattern, suggesting that there is no guarantee that uptake will remain as robust with time. Science, this issue p. 1193 We quantify the oceanic sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) over the period 1994 to 2007 by using observations from the global repeat hydrography program and contrasting them to observations from the 1990s. Using a linear regression\textendash based method, we find a global increase in the anthropogenic CO2 inventory of 34 {$\pm$} 4 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) between 1994 and 2007. This is equivalent to an average uptake rate of 2.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 Pg C year-1 and represents 31 {$\pm$} 4\% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions over this period. Although this global ocean sink estimate is consistent with the expectation of the ocean uptake having increased in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2, substantial regional differences in storage rate are found, likely owing to climate variability\textendash driven changes in ocean circulation. Ocean uptake of atmospheric CO2 continued apace between 1994 and 2007. Ocean uptake of atmospheric CO2 continued apace between 1994 and 2007.},

  abstract = {The forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) NASA satellite mission will measure water surface width, height, and slope of major rivers worldwide. The resulting data could provide an unprecedented account of river discharge at continental scales, but reliable methods need to be identified prior to launch. Here we present a novel algorithm for discharge estimation from only remotely sensed stream width, slope, and height at multiple locations along a mass-conserved river segment. The algorithm, termed the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm, implements a Bayesian formulation of streamflow uncertainty using a combination of Manning's equation and at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG). Bayesian methods provide a statistically defensible approach to generating discharge estimates in a physically underconstrained system but rely on prior distributions that quantify the a priori uncertainty of unknown quantities including discharge and hydraulic equation parameters. These were obtained from literature-reported values and from a USGS data set of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements at USGS stream gauges. A data set of simulated widths, slopes, and heights from 19 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithms using a set of performance metrics. Results across the 19 rivers indicate an improvement in performance of BAM over previously tested methods and highlight a path forward in solving discharge estimation using solely satellite remote sensing.},

Knowing this rate is necessary to calculate river photosynthesis and respiration, but there are few data from large rivers, and there are no data that include whitewater rapids. We studied the Colorado River, Grand Canyon; this river has flat reaches separated by extremely large, steep, whitewater rapids. We measured gas transfer velocity (the height of the water column that can exchange all of its gas per hour) by measuring how quickly the river gained oxygen as it flowed over the first 7 major rapids. The Colorado River has low oxygen concentration as it flows out of Glen Canyon Dam, located 25 kilometers upriver from Lees Ferry. We found that gas transfer velocity increased as river slope increased. Gas transfer velocity was low in flat reaches but was up to 800 times higher in rapids, which were the highest rates ever measured in a river. Based on the rate of change of oxygen concentration per meter of river drop, we estimated gas transfer velocity for the remainder of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. Gas exchange varied 5-fold depending on the slope of the immediate reach. Gas transfer velocity was higher for the Colorado River than for other aquatic ecosystems because of its large rapids. Our approach of scaling gas transfer velocity to the entire river will allow comparing gas transfer velocity across rivers that have variable river slopes, such as the Colorado River, Grand Canyon.},

  abstract = {Gas exchange across the air\textendash water boundary of streams and rivers is a globally large biogeochemical flux. Gas exchange depends on the solubility of the gas of interest, the gas concentrations of the air and water, and the gas exchange velocity (k), usually normalized to a Schmidt number of 600, referred to as k600. Gas exchange velocity is of intense research interest because it is problematic to estimate, is highly spatially variable, and has high prediction error. Theory dictates that molecular diffusivity and turbulence drives variation in k600 in flowing waters. We measure k600 via several methods from direct measures, gas tracer experiments, to modeling of diel changes in dissolved gas concentrations. Many estimates of k600 show that surface turbulence explains variation in k600 leading to predictive models based upon geomorphic and hydraulic variables. These variables include stream channel slope and stream flow velocity, the product of which, is proportional to the energy dissipation rate in streams and rivers. These empirical models provide understanding of the controls on k600, yet high residual variation in k600 show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations. The most appropriate method to estimate gas exchange depends on the scientific question along with the characteristics of the study sites. We provide a decision tree for selecting the best method to estimate k600 for individual river reaches to scaling to river networks.

  abstract = {In situ river discharge estimation is a critical component of studying rivers. A dominant method for establishing discharge monitoring in situ is a temporary gauge, which uses a rating curve to relate stage to discharge. However, this approach is constrained by cost and the time to develop the stage-discharge rating curve, as rating curves rely on numerous flow measurements at high and low stages. Here, we offer a novel alternative approach to traditional temporary gauges: estimating Discharge via Arrays of Pressure Transducers (DAPT). DAPT uses a Bayesian discharge algorithm developed for the upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography satellite (SWOT) to estimate discharge in situ derived from automated water surface elevation measurements. We conducted sensitivity tests over 4,954 model runs on five gauged rivers and conclude that the DAPT method can robustly reproduce discharge with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.79 and Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.78. Further, we find that the DAPT method estimates discharge similarly to an idealized temporary gauge created from the same input data (NSE differences of less than 0.1), and that results improve significantly with accurate priors. Finally, we test the DAPT method in nine poorly gauged rivers in a realistic and complex field setting in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, and show that the DAPT method largely outperforms a temporary gauge in this time and budget constrained setting. We therefore recommend DAPT as an effective tool for in situ discharge estimation in cases where there is not enough time or resources to develop a temporary gauge.

We test this model using simulated data with realistic measurement errors to demonstrate that it accurately estimates the model parameters and that parameter uncertainties correctly scale with error in the observations and number of data points. Application of the model to field data from two productive stream ecosystems with substantial daily dissolved oxygen variation quantified the underlying physical and biological factors that control oxygen dynamics in these ecosystems and provided empirical support for a light saturation model of the photosynthesis-irradiance relationships at the ecosystem scale. Although inclusion of {$\delta$}18O-O2 provides a second oxygen budget, analysis of field data shows that metabolic and reaeration parameters can be accurately estimated by modeling the transient dynamics of dissolved oxygen concentration alone in relation to daily changes in water temperature and light regime. This model is particularly suited to low-gas exchange, high-productivity systems, which have thus far proved challenging to measure ecosystem metabolism accurately. The modeling framework is applicable to single-station, open-system experimental designs and provides a rigorous and generalizable framework for estimating ecosystem metabolism in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {AbstractRemote sensing has gained attention as a novel source of primary information for estimating river discharge, and the Mass conserved Flow Law Inversion (McFLI) approach has successfully estimated river discharge in ungauged basins solely from optical satellite data. However, McFLI currently suffers from two major drawbacks: 1) Existing optical satellites lead to temporally and spatially sparse discharge estimates, and 2) because of the assumptions required, McFLI cannot guarantee downstream flow continuity. Hydrological modeling has neither drawback, yet model accuracy is frequently limited by a lack of discharge observations. We therefore combine McFLI and models in a data assimilation framework applicable globally. We establish a daily ``ungauged'' baseline model for 28,998 reaches of the Missouri river basin forced by recently published global runoff data, which we do not calibrate. We estimate discharge via McFLI using {$\sim$}1 million width measurements made from 12,000 Landsat scenes and assimilate McFLI into the model before validating at 403 USGS gauges. Results show that assimilated discharges did not impair already accurate baseline flows and achieved median improvements of 28\% Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), 0.50 Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and 0.23 Kling Gupta Efficiency (KGE) where baseline performance was poor (defined as baseline negative NSE, 225/403 reaches). We ultimately improved flows at 92\% of these originally poorly modelled gauges, even though Landsat images only provide McFLI discharges at 1.5\% of reaches and 26\% of simulated days. Our results suggest that the combination of McFLI and state-of-the-art hydrology models can improve flow estimations in ungauged basins globally.This article is protected by copyright.

In addition to demonstrating widespread supersaturation and distinct regional variation in pCO2 across the U.S., our analysis revealed that pCO2 significantly declined 78.4 ppmv y-1 from 1973 to 1994.

The first is that kL is proportional to the turnover velocity described by the vertical velocity structure function Dww(r), where r is separation distance between two points. The second is that the scalar exchange between the air-water interface and the waterside turbulence can be suitably described by a length scale proportional to the Batchelor scale lB={$\eta$}Sc-1/2, where Sc is the molecular Schmidt number and {$\eta$} is the Kolmogorov microscale defining the smallest scale of turbulent eddies impacted by fluid viscosity. Using an approximate solution to the von K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation predicting Dww(r) in the inertial and viscous regimes, prior formulations for kL are recovered including (i) , vK is the Kolmogorov velocity defined by the Reynolds number vK{$\eta$}/{$\nu$} = 1 and {$\nu$} is the kinematic viscosity of water; (ii) surface divergence formulations; (iii) , where u{${_\ast}$} is the waterside friction velocity; (iv) for Keulegan numbers exceeding a threshold needed for long-wave generation, where the proportionality constant varies with wave age, g is the gravitational acceleration; and (v) in free convection, where qo is the surface heat flux and {$\beta$}o is the thermal expansion of water.

Increasingly an alternative metric, the Kling\textendash Gupta efficiency (KGE), is used instead. When NSE is used, NSE = 0 corresponds to using the mean flow as a benchmark predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use KGE as a metric: negative KGE values are viewed as bad model performance, and only positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using the mean flow as a predictor does not result in KGE = 0, but {$\surd$} instead KGE = 1 - 2 {$\approx$} -0.41. Thus, KGE values greater than -0.41 indicate that a model improves upon the mean flow benchmark \textendash{} even if the model's KGE value is negative. NSE and KGE values cannot be directly compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on the coefficient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore, modellers who use the KGE metric should not let their understanding of NSE values guide them in interpreting KGE values and instead develop new understanding based on the constitutive parts of the KGE metric and the explicit use of benchmark values to compare KGE scores against. More generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of aggregated efficiency metrics and towards a framework based on purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more robust model adequacy assessment.},

Numerical results are analyzed for three rivers in two different observation contexts (corresponding to the SWOT Cal-Val orbit and to the SWOT nominal orbit) and three different scenarios of prior information availability. These investigations cover numerous realistic worldwide applications. It is shown that the space-time variations of the river discharge Q(x, t) and the bathymetry profile b(x) can be accurately inferred. However the inferred values of Q may be obtained at a multiplicative factor only (a bias). This bias vanishes as soon as an accurate mean value or one reference value of one of the three inferred field is provided. Once the assimilation of the satellite measurements has been done during a sufficiently long time period representing enough flow variability (one year), the low complexity algebraic flow model provides discharge estimations in real computational time from newly acquired measurements.},

Here we present the first global maps of CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) in rivers of stream orders 3 and higher and the resulting FCO2 at 0.5\textdegree{} resolution constructed with a statistical model. A geographic information system based approach is used to derive a pCO2 prediction function trained on data from 1182 sampling locations. While data from Asia and Africa are scarce and the training data set is dominated by sampling locations from the Americas, Europe, and Australia, the sampling locations cover the full spectrum from high to low latitudes. The predictors of pCO2 are net primary production, population density, and slope gradient within the river catchment as well as mean air temperature at the sampling location (r2 = 0.47). The predicted pCO2 map was then combined with spatially explicit estimates of stream surface area Ariver and gas exchange velocity k calculated from published empirical equations and data sets to derive the FCO2 map. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assessed the uncertainties of our estimates. At the global scale, we estimate an average river pCO2 of 2400 (2019\textendash 2826) \textmu atm and a FCO2 of 650 (483\textendash 846) Tg C yr-1 (5th and 95th percentiles of confidence interval). Our global CO2 evasion is substantially lower than the recent estimate of 1800 Tg C yr-1 although the training set of pCO2 is very similar in both studies, mainly due to lower tropical pCO2 estimates in the present study. Our maps reveal strong latitudinal gradients in pCO2, Ariver, and FCO2. The zone between 10\textdegree N and 10\textdegree S contributes about half of the global CO2 evasion. Collection of pCO2 data in this zone, in particular, for African and Southeast Asian rivers is a high priority to reduce uncertainty on FCO2.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporally continuous global river discharge estimates across the full spectrum of stream orders are vital to a range of hydrologic applications, yet they remain poorly constrained. Here we present a carefully designed modeling effort (Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model and Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge river routing model) to estimate global river discharge at very high resolutions. The precipitation forcing is from a recently published 0.1\textdegree{} global product that optimally merged gauge-, reanalysis-, and satellite-based data. To constrain runoff simulations, we use a set of machine learning-derived, global runoff characteristics maps (i.e., runoff at various exceedance probability percentiles) for grid-by-grid model calibration and bias correction. To support spaceborne discharge studies, the river flowlines are defined at their true geometry and location as much as possible\textemdash approximately 2.94 million vector flowlines (median length 6.8 km) and unit catchments are derived from a high-accuracy global digital elevation model at 3-arcsec resolution ( 90 m), which serves as the underlying hydrography for river routing. Our 35-year daily and monthly model simulations are evaluated against over 14,000 gauges globally. Among them, 35\% (64\%) have a percentage bias within {$\pm$}20\% ({$\pm$}50\%), and 29\% (62\%) have a monthly Kling-Gupta Efficiency {$\geq$}0.6 (0.2), showing data robustness at the scale the model is assessed. This reconstructed discharge record can be used as a priori information for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission's discharge product, thus named ``Global Reach-level A priori Discharge Estimates for Surface Water and Ocean Topography''. It can also be used in other hydrologic applications requiring spatially explicit estimates of global river flows.},

The present study attempts to combine the general outcome of such experiments at both interfaces into a universal scaling relation for the thicknesses of the viscous and diffusive sublayers in terms of the Kolmogorov and Batchelor length scales, respectively. Transfer velocities can then be described in terms of the Schmidt number of the respective tracer and in terms of the turbulence dissipation rate. Applying law-of-the-wall scaling to convert dissipation rates into an appropriate friction velocity estimate results in a mechanistic description of the transfer velocity, which is comparable to common empirical parameterizations. It is hypothesized, however, that the dissipation rate and hence the directly estimated level of turbulence provide a more appropriate variable for the parameterization of interfacial fluxes than wind speed or turbulent friction velocity inferred from law-of-the-wall scaling.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Models of dissolved oxygen in streams require accurate estimation of absorption rates of atmospheric oxygen, or ``reaeration rates.'' These depend upon gas transfer coefficients, which engineers predict as functions of mean flow depth, velocity, and slope. Though many such equations have been developed, errors remain large, pointing to a need for an additional degree of description. Noting that streams vary widely in hydraulic geometry, a set of laboratory studies finds that reaeration rates are enhanced by ``macroroughness,'' large bed variations that produce depth-scale form drag. This enhancement is accurately described by a theory that was successful in smooth-channel flows, upon accounting for increases in near-surface turbulent energy dissipation rates caused by macroroughness. In addition, a set of runs featuring bubble entrainment exhibits very high absorption rates, which are characterized by a Froude number based on macroroughness size.},

This study assimilated water level information derived from a fused satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image and digital terrain model (DTM) with simulations from a coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic model to estimate discharge in an un-gauged basin scenario. Assimilating water level measurements led to a 79\% reduction in ensemble discharge uncertainty over the coupled hydrological hydrodynamic model alone. Measurement bias was evident, but the method still provided a means of improving estimates of discharge for high flows. The study demonstrates the potential of currently available synthetic aperture radar imagery to reduce discharge uncertainty in un-gauged basins when combined with model simulations in a data assimilation framework, where sufficient topographic data are available. The work is timely because in the near future the launch of satellite radar missions will lead to a significant increase in the volume of data available for space-borne discharge estimation.

New production values obtained with these analyses of oxygen curves from various sources, as well as a few previously existing estimates of primary production, indicate a generally higher rate of production in flowing waters than in other types of aquatic environments. The ratio of total primary production to total community respiration is used to classify communities quantitatively according to their predominantly heterotrophic or autotrophic characteristics. Longitudinal succession within a stream tends to modify the ratio towards unity from higher values for autotrophic and from lower values for heterotrophic communities. The behavior of this ratio is described for the annual cycle in a stream, for the sequence of pollution recovery, and for diverse types of communities.},

This work investigates the estimation of river discharge from simulated observations of the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission using a variant of the classical variational data assimilation method ``4D-Var.'' The variational assimilation scheme simultaneously estimates discharge, river bathymetry, and bed roughness in the context of a 1.5 D full Saint-Venant hydraulic model. Algorithms and procedures are developed to apply the method to fully ungauged basins. The method was tested on the Po and Sacramento Rivers. The SWOT hydrology simulator was used to produce synthetic SWOT observations at each overpass time by simulating the interaction of SWOT radar measurements with the river water surface and nearby land surface topography at a scale of approximately 1 m, thus accounting for layover, thermal noise, and other effects. SWOT data products were synthesized by vectorizing the simulated radar returns, leading to height and width estimates at 200 m increments along the river centerlines. The ingestion of simulated SWOT data generally led to local improvements on prior bathymetry and roughness estimates which allowed the prediction of river discharge at the overpass times with relative root mean squared errors of 12.1\% and 11.2\% for the Po and Sacramento Rivers, respectively. Nevertheless, equifinality issues that arise from the simultaneous estimation of bed elevation and roughness may prevent their use for different applications, other than discharge estimation through the presented framework.},

Results indicate that rarely is there a single best prediction equation in a given velocity-depth region, rather there usually is a group of statistically indistinguishable top-performing equations. Also, no single reaeration equation performed well over all hydraulic conditions. Prediction equations, which include slope as a variable are more accurate and have lower bias than those that do not. However, even the top-performing equations exhibited large prediction errors of at least 40\textendash 50\% and exceeded 100\% in some regions.

Four baseline data sets determine relations for bankfull geometry, i.e., bankfull depth, bankfull width, and down-channel slope as functions of bankfull discharge and bed surface median sediment size. These relations show a considerable degree of universality. This universality applies not only within the four sets used to determine the forms but also to three independent data sets as well. We study the physical basis for this universality in terms of four relations, the coefficients and exponents of which can be back calculated from the data: (1) a Manning-Strickler-type relation for channel resistance, (2) a channel-forming relation expressed in terms of the ratio of bankfull Shields number to critical Shields number, (3) a relation for critical Shields number as a function of dimensionless discharge, and (4) a ``gravel yield'' relation specifying the (estimated) gravel transport rate at bankfull flow as a function of bankfull discharge and gravel size. We use these underlying relations to explore why the dimensionless bankfull relations are only quasi-universal and to quantify the degree to which deviation from universality can be expected. The analysis presented here represents an alternative to extremal formulations to predict hydraulic geometry.},

To evaluate these, exponent data for 139 at-a-station sites and for 72 downstream cases were collected from the literature, and variations in the data analyzed. Histogram analysis revealed substantial differences in the exponents when considered independently, and to facilitate simultaneous comparison between the three exponents the data were plotted on tri-axial diagrams, with one axis per exponent. This was done for the at-a-station and downstream data separately. Variations within and between major climatic areas could be examined, and similarities between theoretically derived and empirically observed data appreciated. Some confusion in the literature is attributed to five basic observations. These are the fact that downstream relationships have been related to different flow levels in different studies; differences might be expected between gaging station and field data; several different methods of fitting lines to relationships have been applied; a concern has recently been expressed that simple power functions may not be the best way of empirically describing the hydraulic geometry relationships in some cases; and, finally, the debate on whether or not velocity decreases downstream at a constant flow frequency has been perpetuated and remains largely unresolved.},

An extensive new field data set for the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada quantifies robust positive relationships between in situ suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and remotely sensed visible/near-infrared reflectance. These relationships are exploited using SPOT and ASTER satellite images to map suspended sediment concentrations across the PAD for four days in 2006 and 2007, revealing strong variations in water sources and flow patterns, including flow reversals in major distributaries. Near-daily monitoring with 276 MODIS satellite images tracks hydrologic recharge of floodplain lakes, as revealed by episodic infusions of sediment-rich water from the Athabasca River. The timing and magnitude of lake recharge are linked to springtime water level on the Athabasca River, suggesting a system sensitive to changes in river flow regime. Moreover, recharge timing differentiates lakes that are frequently and extensively recharged from those recharged more rarely. Finally, we present a first estimation of river flow velocity based on remotely sensed SSC, though saturation may occur at velocities {$>$}0.6 m/s. Viewed collectively, the different remote sensing methodologies presented here suggest strong value for visible/near-infrared remote sensing of suspended sediment to assess hydrologic and sediment transport processes in complex flow environments.

Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32 Pg C yr-1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr-1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.},

Turbulent energy at the air\textendash water interface scales with the gas transfer velocity (k), which can be measured in streams through various methods. We performed a metadata analysis of studies that have measured k in streams using direct gas tracer releases. We evaluated models that predict k based on stream morphology. We found that models that use slope and velocity to predict k perform reasonably well and are consistent with general theory. We also used the data set to provide new stream hydraulic equations that predict stream morphology (width, depth, velocity) based on discharge.},

Seasonal patterns of u* and w* were dissimilar; u* was often highest in the spring, while w*increased throughout the summer to a maximum in early fall. Convection was a larger mixed-layer turbulence source than wind shear (u*/w* {$<$} 0.75) for 18 of the 40 lakes, including all 11 lakes {$<$}10 ha. As a consequence, the relative contribution of convection to the gas transfer velocity (k, estimated by the surface renewal model) was greater for small lakes.

Because u* and w*differ in temporal pattern and magnitude across lakes, both convection and wind shear should be considered in future formulations of lake-air gas exchange, especially for small lakes.},

  abstract = {Headwater streams are key sites of nutrient and organic matter processing and retention, but little is known about temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates as a result of the short duration of most metabolism measurements in lotic ecosystems. We examined temporal variability and controls on ecosystem metabolism by measuring daily rates continuously for 2~years in Walker Branch, a first-order deciduous forest stream. Four important scales of temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism rates were identified: (1) seasonal, (2) day-to-day, (3) episodic (storm-related), and (4) inter-annual. Seasonal patterns were largely controlled by the leaf phenology and productivity of the deciduous riparian forest. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic throughout the year with the exception of the open-canopy spring when GPP and ER rates were co-equal. Day-to-day variability in weather conditions influenced light reaching the streambed, resulting in high day-to-day variability in GPP particularly during spring (daily light levels explained 84\% of the variance in daily GPP in April). Episodic storms depressed GPP for several days in spring, but increased GPP in autumn by removing leaves shading the streambed. Storms depressed ER initially, but then stimulated ER to 2\textendash 3 times pre-storm levels for several days. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic in both years of the study, with annual GPP being similar (488 and 519~g O2~m-2~y-1 or 183 and 195~g~C~m-2~y-1) but annual ER being higher in 2004 than 2005 (-1,645 vs. -1,292 g~O2~m-2~y-1 or -617 and -485~g~C~m-2~y-1). Inter-annual variability in ecosystem metabolism (assessed by comparing 2004 and 2005 rates with previous measurements) was the result of the storm frequency and timing and the size of the spring macroalgal bloom. Changes in local climate can have substantial impacts on stream ecosystem metabolism rates and ultimately influence the carbon source and sink properties of these important ecosystems.},

Air concentrations immediately above stream surfaces were close to mean atmospheric conditions except during calm summer nights. Piston velocity from 0.4 to 21.6~cm~h-1 was closely related to current velocity permitting calculation of evasion rates for entire streams. CO2 evasion rates were highest in midstream reaches (170\textendash 1,200~mmol~m-2~day-1) where CO2-rich soil water entered fast stream flow, while rates were tenfold lower (25\textendash 100~mmol~m-2~day-1) in slow-flowing lower reaches. CO2 evasion mainly derived from the input of CO2 in soil water. The variability of CO2 evasion along the two lowland streams covered much of the range in sub-Arctic and temperate streams reported previously. In budgets for the two stream catchments, loss of carbon from soils via the hydrological cycle was substantial (3.2\textendash 5.7~mmol~m-2~day-1) and dominated by CO2 consumed to form HCO3- by mineral dissolution (69\textendash 76\%) and export of organic carbon (15\textendash 23\%) relative to dissolved CO2 export (7\textendash 9\%).},

  abstract = {Surface waters contribute substantially to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. However, global estimates remain uncertain due to methodological difficulties, such as in precisely estimating gas transfer in steep upland streams. Here, we addressed the question of what drives CO2 evasion from steep mountainous stream network of the European Alps by assessing the spatial and temporal variation of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) for 148 streams and the gas transfer coefficient for CO2 (kCO2) for 88 locations within this 254 km2 watershed. Results show that log kCO2 can be predicted reasonably well (r2 = 0.71, p{$<$}0.001, n = 88) using a statistical model based on slope, average width, flow velocity and stream discharge. Also, most sites were supersaturated in CO2 with significant variation in pCO2 due to season (September vs. December) and time of day (day vs. night), but not stream order. Resulting median CO2 evasion rates were 145, 119, 46, 43, and 50 mg C m-2 h-1 at 1st to 5th order streams, respectively. CO2 evasion was dependent on season and time of day, with the highest evasion (184.0 kg C h-1) during growing season at nighttime, followed by 124.6 kg C h-1 during daytime. Dormant season nighttime evasion was 30.9 kg C h-1 and daytime evasion only 17.1 kg C h-1. Overall we conclude that CO2 evasion of steep mountainous streams depends on seasonal and diurnal variation in pCO2 and reach-specific variability in kCO2. These controls strongly alter landscape-scale CO2 evasion estimates, with implications for regional to global carbon budgets.},

A number of theories have since been proposed. Some of the theories are interrelated but others are based on quite different principles. All theories, however, assume that the river flow is steady and uniform and the river tends to attain a state of equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium. The differences are due to the differences in hydraulic mechanisms that the theories employ to explain the attainment of equilibrium by the river.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the capability of the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate river discharge, even for ungauged sites. Because of its frequent revisits (as little as every 3h) and adequate spatial resolution (250m), MODIS bands 1 and 2 have significant potential for mapping the extent of flooded areas and estimating river discharge even for medium-sized basins. Specifically, the different behaviour of water and land in the Near Infrared (NIR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is exploited by computing the ratio (C/M) of the MODIS channel 2 reflectance values between two pixels located within (M) and outside (C), but close to, the river. The values of C/M increase with the presence of water and, hence, with discharge. Moreover, in order to reduce the noise effects due to atmospheric contribution, an exponential smoothing filter is applied, thus obtaining C/M⁎. Time series of hourly mean flow velocity and discharge between 2005 and 2011 measured at four gauging stations located along the Po river (Northern Italy) are employed for testing the capability of C/M⁎ to estimate discharge/flow velocity. Specifically, the meanders and urban areas are considered the best locations for the position of the pixels M and C, respectively. Considering the optimal pixels, the agreement between C/M⁎ and discharge/flow velocity is fairly good with values in the range of 0.65\textendash 0.77. Additionally, the application to ungauged sites is tested by deriving a unique regional relationship between C/M⁎ and flow velocity valid for the whole Po river and providing only a slight deterioration of the performance. Finally, the sensitivity of the results to the selection of the C and M pixels is investigated by randomly changing their location. Also in this case, the agreement with in situ observations of velocity is fairly satisfactory (r\textasciitilde 0.6). The obtained results demonstrate the capability of MODIS to monitor discharge (and flow velocity). Therefore, its application for a larger number of sites worldwide will be the object of future studies.},

Spates shifted ecosystem metabolism toward heterotrophy (decreased P/R) because gross primary production was more affected than ecosystem respiration. Recovery rates of gross primary production were high in summer and low in winter. Recovery of ecosystem respiration showed less distinct seasonal variation. Energy flow through the system was calculated as the sum of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. Upper (maximum energy flow) and lower (resistant energy flow) boundaries were estimated, within which energy flow varied. The ratio of maximum to resistant energy flow, which ranged from 6.1 to 9.6, indicated that resistance to spates was small, at least after extended periods free of spates (5-8 wk).},

Despite the presence of mountain streams worldwide, we lack basic understanding of gas exchange through their turbulent surfaces, making global estimates of outgassing from streams and rivers difficult to constrain. Here we combine new estimates of gas transfer velocities from tracer gas additions in mountain streams with published data to cover streams differing in geomorphology and hydraulics. We find two different scaling relationships between the turbulence-induced energy dissipation rate and gas transfer velocity for low- and high-channel slope streams, indicating that gas exchange in streams exists in two states. We suggest that turbulent diffusion drives gas transfer velocity in low-energy streams; whereas turbulence entrains air bubbles in high-energy streams, and the resulting bubble-mediated gas exchange accelerates with energy dissipation rate. Gas transfer velocities in the high-energy streams are among the highest reported. Our findings offer a framework to include mountain streams in future estimates of gas fluxes from streams and rivers at the global scale.},

  abstract = {Boreal streams represent potentially important conduits for the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. The gas transfer coefficient of CO2 (KCO2) is a key variable in estimating this source strength, but the scarcity of measured values in lotic systems creates a risk of incorrect flux estimates even when stream gas concentrations are well known. This study used 114 independent measurements of KCO2 from 14 stream reaches in a boreal headwater system to determine and predict spatiotemporal variability in KCO2. The KCO2 values ranged from 0.001 to 0.207 min-1 across the 14 sites. Median KCO2 for a specific site was positively correlated with the slope of the stream reach, with higher gas transfer coefficients occurring in steeper stream sections. Combining slope with a width/depth index of the stream reach explained 83\% of the spatial variability in KCO2. Temporal variability was more difficult to predict and was strongly site specific. Variation in KCO2, rather than pCO2, was the main determinant of stream CO2 evasion. Applying published generalized gas transfer velocities produced an error of up to 100\% in median instantaneous evasion rates compared to the use of actual measured KCO2 values from our field study. Using the significant relationship to local slope, the median KCO2 was predicted for 300,000 km of watercourses (ranging in stream order 1\textendash 4) in the forested landscape of boreal/nemoral Sweden. The range in modeled stream order specific median KCO2 was 0.017\textendash 0.028 min-1 and there was a clear gradient of increasing KCO2 with lower stream order. We conclude that accurate regional scale estimates of CO2 evasion fluxes from running waters are possible, but require a good understanding of gas exchange at the water surface.},

  abstract = {Air-water gas transfer influences fundamental processes of aquatic systems such as photosynthesis, respiration, and greenhouse gas emission. Previous predictive models for gas transfer velocity (KL) often only apply to a small range of streams and rivers. Two ``universal'' scalings, KL {$\sim$} 1/4 power of turbulent dissipation rate ({$\epsilon$}1/4) and KL {$\sim$} shear velocity (U*), deduced from classic thin-film theory and surface renewal theory, have been reported for lake and marine systems, but have not been adequately tested for streams or rivers. To test the two scalings and understand how KL varies across systems, we compiled 588 field measurements of KL, and used inverse modeling based on long-term high-frequency dissolved oxygen time series to estimate KL of 35 streams and rivers capturing a wide range of discharge (0\textendash 221 m3/s). We found that the two scalings held for both the KL estimated by inverse modeling and the KL from measurements and outperformed 23 previous models in predicting KL. Furthermore, the main driver of KL variation shifts from bottom friction to other factors with increasing stream/river size. In most streams and a few rivers, correlation between U* and KL is high, and discharge-KL relationships are strongly positive, indicating that turbulence generated by bottom friction dominates near-surface turbulence, a fundamental control of KL, thus, the two scaling models are applicable to these systems. However, most rivers (mean discharge {$>$}10 m3/s) show low correlations between U* and KL, suggesting biochemical factors and winds likely override bottom friction in driving near-surface turbulence and KL.},

  abstract = {The past decade has seen a substantial amount of research on air-sea gas exchange and its environmental controls. These studies have significantly advanced the understanding of processes that control gas transfer, led to higher quality field measurements, and improved estimates of the flux of climate-relevant gases between the ocean and atmosphere. This review discusses the fundamental principles of air-sea gas transfer and recent developments in gas transfer theory, parameterizations, and measurement techniques in the context of the exchange of carbon dioxide. However, much of this discussion is applicable to any sparingly soluble, non-reactive gas. We show how the use of global variables of environmental forcing that have recently become available and gas exchange relationships that incorporate the main forcing factors will lead to improved estimates of global and regional air-sea gas fluxes based on better fundamental physical, chemical, and biological foundations.},

  abstract = {Relationships between wind speed and gas transfer, combined with knowledge of the partial pressure difference of CO2 across the air-sea interface are frequently used to determine the CO2 flux between the ocean and the atmosphere. Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural-14C disequilibrium and the bomb-14C inventory methods. Some of the variability between different data sets can be accounted for by the suggested mechanisms, but much of the variation appears due to other causes. Possible causes for the large difference between two frequently used relationships between gas transfer and wind speed are discussed. To determine fluxes of gases other than CO2 across the air-water interface, the relevant expressions for gas transfer, and the temperature and salinity dependence of the Schmidt number and solubility of several gases of environmental interest are included in an appendix.},

  abstract = {Air-water gas transfer influences CO2 and other climatically important trace gas fluxes on regional and global scales, yet the magnitude of the transfer is not well known. Widely used models of gas exchange rates are based on empirical relationships linked to wind speed, even though physical processes other than wind are known to play important roles. Here the first field investigations are described supporting a new mechanistic model based on surface water turbulence that predicts gas exchange for a range of aquatic and marine processes. Findings indicate that the gas transfer rate varies linearly with the turbulent dissipation rate to the power in a range of systems with different types of forcing - in the coastal ocean, in a macro-tidal river estuary, in a large tidal freshwater river, and in a model (i.e., artificial) ocean. These results have important implications for understanding carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {The gradient flux technique, which measures the gas transfer velocity (k), and new observational techniques that probe turbulence in the aqueous surface boundary layers were conducted over a tidal cycle in the Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts. Efforts were aimed at testing new methods in an estuarine system and to determine if turbulence created by tidal velocity can be responsible for the short-term variability in k. Measurements were made during a low wind day, at a site with tidal excursions of 2.7 m and a range in tidal velocity of nearly 1 m sϪ1. Estimates of k using the gradient flux technique were made simultaneously with the Controlled Flux Technique (CFT), infrared imagery, and high-resolution turbulence measurements, which measure the surface renewal rate, turbulent scales, and the turbulent dissipation rate, respectively. All measurements were conducted from a small mobile catamaran that minimizes air- and water-side flow distortions. Infrared imagery showed considerable variability in the turbulent scales that affect air-water gas exchange. These measurements were consistent with variation in the surface renewal rate (range 0.02 to 2 sϪ1), the turbulent dissipation rate (range 10Ϫ7 to 10Ϫ5 W kgϪ1), and k (range 2.2 to 12.0 cm hrϪ1). During this low wind day, all variables were shown to correlate with tidal speed. Taken collectively our results indicate the promise of these methods for determining short-term variability in gas transfer and near surface turbulence in estuaries and demonstrate that turbulent transport associated with tidal velocity is a potentially important factor with respect to gas exchange in coastal systems.},
