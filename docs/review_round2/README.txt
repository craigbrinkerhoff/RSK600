The `fin/` folder houses the pdfs and manuscript docx that were actually submitted to journal.

FOR THE REVIEWER RESPONSE AND THE TRACKED CHANGES DOCUMENT:
The 'v2' documents should be identical to the documents saved in `/fin`. When in doubt, just resave the v2 docs to pdf within that folder.

FOR THE MANUSCRIPT AND SI:
The `fin/` documents are manually edited slightly to clean up some artifacts of knitting Rmd files. They will NOT be identical to the documents in the main folder ('manuscript_r2' and 'supp_r2')
